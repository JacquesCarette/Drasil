\chapter{Introduction}
Drasil is a framework that generates software, including code, documentation, software requirement specification, user manual, axillary files, and so on. We call those artifacts ``software artifacts''. At the moment, the Drasil framework targets generating software for scientific problems. Drasil is developed in the Haskell environment. Recently, the Drasil team has been interested in expanding its knowledge to solve a higher-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). It would be difficult to directly add ODE knowledge into the Drasil framework because this requires Drasil to have codified knowledge for ODE, which Drasil currently does not have. Thus, we believe a compromised way to solve a higher-order ODE is to generate a program that solves the ODE numerically using external libraries. There are three main reasons why we want to do that:

1. Scientists and researchers frequently use ODEs as a research model in scientific problems because they come up so often in describing natural phenomena. Building a research model in software is relatively common, and the software that the Drasil framework generates can solve scientific problems. Thus, expanding the Drasil framework's potential to solve all ODEs would solve many scientific problems. Currently, Drasil can only solve first-order ODEs numerically.

2. Many external libraries are hard to write and embody much knowledge, so the Drasil team wants to reuse them instead of reproducing them.

3. Another reason is that the Drasil team is interested in how the Drasil framework interacts with external libraries. Once the team understands how to interact between the Drasil framework and external libraries, they will start to add more external libraries. In this way, we will unlock the potential for the Drasil framework to solve more scientific problems. 

The Drasil framework neither captures ODE knowledge nor solves higher-order ordinary differential equations. Previous researcher~\citep{brooks} incorporated solving a first-order ODE, but it only covers a small area of the knowledge of ordinary differential equations. Most first-order ODE knowledge was captured by following the knowledge-based approach~\citep{szymczaketal2016}. Adding higher-order linear ODEs into the Drasil framework will expand the area where it has never reached before. Therefore, my research will incorporate higher-order linear ODEs in a complex knowledge-based and generative environment that can link to externally provided libraries.

To solve a higher-order linear ODE, we have to represent ODEs in the Drasil database. On the one hand, users can input an ODE as naturally as writing an ODE in mathematical expressions. On the other hand, they can display the ODE in the style of conventional mathematical expressions. The data representation will preserve the relationship between each element in the equation. Then, we will analyze the commonality and variability of selected four external libraries. This analysis will lead us to know how external libraries solve ODEs, what their capabilities are, what options they have, and what interfaces look like. Then, we need to bridge the gap between the Drasil ODE data representation and external libraries. The Drasil ODE data representation cannot directly communicate with external libraries. Each library has its own interface in terms of solving ODEs. The existing gap requires a transformation from the Drasil ODE data representation to a generic data form before solving ODEs in each programming language. Finally, users can run software artifacts to get the numerical solution of the ODE.

Before conducting my research, the Drasil framework could solve explicit equations and numerically solve a first-order ODE. After my research, the Drasil framework will have full capability to solve a higher-order linear ODE numerically. Cases study of NoPCM and PDController will utilize a newly created model to generate programs to solve a higher-order linear ODE in four different programming languages. In addition, we will explore the possibility of solving a system of ODE numerically. We will introduce a new case study, Double Pendulum, which contains an example that solves a system of higher-order nonlinear ODE.

Chapter 2 will cover how to represent the data of linear ODE in Drasil. Then, in Chapter 3, we will analyze external libraries. In Chapter 4, we will explore how to connect the Drasil ODE data representation with external libraries.
