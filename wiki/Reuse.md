Right now, just a dumping ground for papers.

- There was a survey done in 2005 [Software Reuse Research: Status and Future](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~feldt/courses/sple/papers/frakes_2005_sw_reuse_status_and_future.pdf), cited 1043 times.
- Can't find a more recent survey, but something like [CODE reuse in practice: Benefiting or harming technical debt](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110618) seems to have a good recent overview.
- [Quality, productivity and economic benefits of software reuse: a review of industrial studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-007-9040-x) (from 2007)
