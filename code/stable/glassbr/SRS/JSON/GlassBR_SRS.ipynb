    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Software is helpful to efficiently and correctly predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab. The blast under consideration is any kind of man-made explosion. The software, herein called GlassBR, aims to predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab using an intuitive interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for GlassBR. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the GlassBR. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of GlassBR. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes determining the safety of a glass slab under a blast loading following the ASTM standard (<a href=#astm2009>astm2009</a> ).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of second year calculus, structural mechanics, glass breakage, blast risk, computer applications in civil engineering, and applicable standards for constructions using glass from <a href=#astm2009>astm2009</a> , <a href=#astm2012>astm2012</a> , and <a href=#astm2016>astm2016</a>  in [references](#Sec:References). The users of GlassBR can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a>  and <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> , with some aspects taken from Volere template 16 <a href=#rbrtsn2012>rbrtsn2012</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [data definitions](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs). The data definitions are used to support the definitions of the different models.\n",

    "The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsA](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsA) shows the dependencies of assumptions on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsAll) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphRefvsRef](#Figure:TraceGraphRefvsRef) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsR](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsR) shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsAll) shows the dependencies of dependencies of assumptions, models, definitions, requirements, goals, and changes with each other.\n",
