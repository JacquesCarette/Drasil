# Table of Symbols {#Sec:ToS}

The symbols used in this document are summarized in the [Table of Symbols](./SecToS.md#Table:ToS) along with their units. Throughout the document, a subscript \\(i\\) indicates that the value will be taken at, and analyzed at, a slice or slice interface composing the total slip mass. For vector quantities, the units shown are for each component of the vector.
