-- | Constructor for the Introduction section. In order, the parameters are:
--
--     * problemIntroduction - 'Sentence' introducing the specific example problem.
--     * programDefinition  - 'Sentence' definition of the specific example.
--     * subSections        - List of subsections for this section.

-- | Constructor for Purpose of Document subsection. Takes a list of 'Sentence's that:
--
--     * Given one element: explains the purpose of the specific example.
--     * Given two elements: explains the purpose of the specific example and the development process.
--     * Otherwise: Uses the default 'developmentProcessParagraph'.
