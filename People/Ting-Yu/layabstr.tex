Jupyter Notebook is a widely-used web application that enables users to create 
and share documentation, especially for scientific and engineering problems, 
due to its flexibility and ability to integrate text and code in a single 
document. To improve the efficiency of software documentation development, 
Drasil offers a framework that allows users to provide high-level information 
about their scientific problems and generates software documentation for them 
using the standardized Software Requirements Specification (SRS) template. In 
this work, we contribute to Drasil by generating Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on 
achieving three goals: generating SRS in notebook format, generating 
educational documents (i.e., lesson plans), and combining text and code in 
Drasil-generated Jupyter Notebooks.
