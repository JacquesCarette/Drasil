    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic process control with a controller (P/PI/PD/PID) is used in a variety of applications such as thermostats, automobile cruise-control, etc. The gains of a controller in an application must be tuned before the controller is ready for production. Therefore a simulation of the PD Controller with a Second Order System is created in this project that can be used to tune the gain constants.\n",

    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for PD Controller. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",

    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes a PD Control Loop with three subsystems, namely: a PD Controller, a Summing Point, and a Power Plant. Only the Proportional and Derivative controllers are used in this software; the Integral controller is beyond the scope of this project. Additionally, this software is intended to aid with the manual tuning of the PD Controller.\n",
