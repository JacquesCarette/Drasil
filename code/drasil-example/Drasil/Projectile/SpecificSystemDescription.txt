Coordinate System
The coordinate system used is set up so that the positive x-direction is the direction from the launcher to the target and the positive y-direction is up.

Physical System Description
Elements:
	1) The projectile
	2) The launcher
	3) The target

Assumptions
1) The projectile motion is in 2D.
2) The projectile is a point mass.
3) The heights of the launcher and target are equal.
4) Acceleration is zero in the x-direction.
5) Acceleration in the y-direction is only caused by gravity.
6) The effects of the Earth's curvature are ignored.
7) The flight is free; there are no collisions during the trajectory of the projectile

Goal Statments
1) Calculate the landing position of the projectile.

Theoretical Models
1) v = ds/dt (vectors)
2) a = dv/dt (vectors)

General Definitions
1) v_f = v_i + a*t
2) t = 2*v_i*sin(θ)/(|a|) (from GD1 and DD2)
	- v at max height = 0
	- t at max height = t_total/2 (from A3)
3) d = v_i_x*t + a_x*(t^2)/2 (from A5)
4) d = 2*(v_i^2)*sin(θ)*cos(θ)/(|a|) (from A4, A5, GD2, and GD3)

Data Definitions
1) v_x = v*cos(θ)
2) v_y = v*sin(θ)

Instance Models
1) short = d_aim > d
2) offset = |d_aim - d|
3) hit = offset < 0.02 * d_aim

Data Constraints
Input
v > 0
0 < θ < 90
d > 0
