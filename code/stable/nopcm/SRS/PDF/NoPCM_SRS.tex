\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Intro}
Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems provide a novel way of storing energy.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{Sec:DocPurpose}
The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Solar Water Heating System. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SWHS. With the exception of \hyperref[Sec:SysConstraints]{system constraints}, this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.

This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out \cite{parnasClements1986}, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to ``fake'' a rational design process.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
\label{Sec:ReqsScope}
The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:ReaderChars}
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of heat transfer theory from level 3 or 4 mechanical engineering and differential equations from level 1 and 2 calculus. The users of NoPCM can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in \hyperref[Sec:UserChars]{Sec:User Characteristics}.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
\label{Sec:DocOrg}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by \cite{koothoor2013} and \cite{smithLai2005}. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{instance models} and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The \hyperref[Sec:GoalStmt]{goal statements} are refined to the theoretical models and the \hyperref[Sec:TMs]{theoretical models} to the \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{instance models}. The instance model to be solved is referred to as \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM:eBalanceOnWtr}. The instance model provides the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that models the solar water heating system. SWHS solves this ODE.

\section{General System Description}
\label{Sec:GenSysDesc}
This section provides general information about the system. It identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user characteristics, and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}
\label{Sec:SysContext}
\hyperref[Figure:SysCon]{Fig:SysCon} shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SWHS). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../../datafiles/swhs/SystemContextFigure.png}
\caption{\hyperref[Figure:SysCon]{Fig:SysCon}: System Context}
\label{Figure:SysCon}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
SWHS is mostly self-contained. The only external interaction is through the user interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{User Responsibilities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Provide the input data to the system, ensuring no errors in the data entry}
\item{Take care that consistent units are used for input variables}
\end{itemize}
\item{SWHS Responsibilities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a floating point number}
\item{Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints}
\item{Calculate the required outputs}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{Sec:UserChars}
The end user of SWHS should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1 Calculus and Physics.

\subsection{System Constraints}
\label{Sec:SysConstraints}
There are no system constraints.

\section{Specific System Description}
\label{Sec:SpecSystDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.

\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{Sec:ProbDesc}
A system is needed to investigate the heating of water in a solar water heating tank.

\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}
\label{Sec:TermDefs}
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Heat flux: The rate of thermal energy transfer through a given surface per unit time.}
\item{Specific heat capacity: The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the unit mass of a given substance by a given amount.}
\item{Thermal conduction: The transfer of heat energy through a substance.}
\item{Transient: Changing with time.}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Physical System Description}
\label{Sec:PhysSyst}
The physical system of SWHS, as shown in \hyperref[Figure:Tank]{Fig:Tank}, includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item[PS1:]{Tank containing water.}
\item[PS2:]{Heating coil at bottom of tank. (${q_{\text{C}}}$ represents the heat flux into the water from the coil.)}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../../datafiles/nopcm/TankWaterOnly.png}
\caption{Solar water heating tank, with heat flux from heating coil of ${q_{\text{C}}}$}
\label{Figure:Tank}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\label{Sec:GoalStmt}
Given the temperature of the heating coil, the initial temperature of the water, and the material properties, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Predict-Water-Temperature:\phantomsection\label{waterTempGS}]{Predict the temperature of the water over time.}
\item[Predict-Water-Energy:\phantomsection\label{waterEnergyGS}]{Predict the change in heat energy in the water over time.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\label{Sec:SolCharSpec}
The instance models that govern NoPCM are presented in the \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Instance Model Section}. The information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\label{Sec:Assumps}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical models by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The assumptions refine the scope by providing more detail.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Thermal-Energy-Only:\phantomsection\label{assumpTEO}]{The only form of energy that is relevant for this problem is thermal energy. All other forms of energy, such as mechanical energy, are assumed to be negligible. (RefBy: \hyperref[TM:consThermE]{TM:consThermE}.)}
\item[Heat-Transfer-Coeffs-Constant:\phantomsection\label{assumpHTCC}]{All heat transfer coefficients are constant over time. (RefBy: \hyperref[TM:nwtnCooling]{TM:nwtnCooling}.)}
\item[Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank:\phantomsection\label{assumpCWTAT}]{The water in the tank is fully mixed, so the temperature of the water is the same throughout the entire tank. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD:rocTempSimp}.)}
\item[Density-Water-Constant-over-Volume:\phantomsection\label{assumpDWCoW}]{The density of water has no spatial variation; that is, it is constant over their entire volume. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD:rocTempSimp}.)}
\item[Specific-Heat-Energy-Constant-over-Volume:\phantomsection\label{assumpSHECoW}]{The specific heat capacity of water has no spatial variation; that is, it is constant over its entire volume. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD:rocTempSimp}.)}
\item[Newton-Law-Convective-Cooling-Coil-Water:\phantomsection\label{assumpLCCCW}]{Newton's law of convective cooling applies between the heating coil and the water. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil}.)}
\item[Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Time:\phantomsection\label{assumpTHCCoT}]{The temperature of the heating coil is constant over time. (RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgTCVOD]{LC:Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Day} and \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil}.)}
\item[Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length:\phantomsection\label{assumpTHCCoL}]{The temperature of the heating coil does not vary along its length. (RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgTCVOL]{LC:Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Length}.)}
\item[Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge:\phantomsection\label{assumpCTNTD}]{The model only accounts for charging the tank, not discharging. The temperature of the water can only increase, or remain constant; it cannot decrease. This implies that the initial temperature is less than (or equal to) the temperature of the heating coil. (RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgDT]{LC:Discharging-Tank}.)}
\item[Water-Always-Liquid:\phantomsection\label{assumpWAL}]{The operating temperature range of the system is such that the material (water in this case) is always in liquid state. That is, the temperature will not drop below the melting point temperature of water, or rise above its boiling point temperature. (RefBy: \hyperref[unlikeChgWFS]{UC:Water-Fixed-States}, \hyperref[TM:sensHtE]{TM:sensHtE}, \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM:heatEInWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM:eBalanceOnWtr}.)}
\item[Perfect-Insulation-Tank:\phantomsection\label{assumpPIT}]{The tank is perfectly insulated so that there is no heat loss from the tank. (RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgTLH]{LC:Tank-Lose-Heat} and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM:eBalanceOnWtr}.)}
\item[No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water:\phantomsection\label{assumpNIHGBW}]{No internal heat is generated by the water; therefore, the volumetric heat generation per unit volume is zero. (RefBy: \hyperref[unlikeChgNIHG]{UC:No-Internal-Heat-Generation} and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM:eBalanceOnWtr}.)}
\item[Atmospheric-Pressure-Tank:\phantomsection\label{assumpAPT}]{The pressure in the tank is atmospheric, so the melting point temperature and boiling point temperature of water are 0${{}^{\circ}\text{C}}$ and 100${{}^{\circ}\text{C}}$, respectively. (RefBy: \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM:heatEInWtr}.)}
\item[Volume-Coil-Negligible:\phantomsection\label{assumpVCN}]{When considering the volume of water in the tank, the volume of the heating coil is assumed to be negligible. (RefBy: \hyperref[DD:waterVolume.nopcm]{DD:waterVolume\_nopcm}.)}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}

Integrating \hyperref[TM:consThermE]{TM:consThermE} over a volume ($V$), we have:

\begin{displaymath}
-\int_{V}{∇\cdot{}\symbf{q}}\,dV+\int_{V}{g}\,dV=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
Applying Gauss's Divergence Theorem to the first term over the surface $S$ of the volume, with $\symbf{q}$ as the thermal flux vector for the surface and $\symbf{\hat{n}}$ as a unit outward normal vector for a surface:

\begin{displaymath}
-\int_{S}{\symbf{q}\cdot{}\symbf{\hat{n}}}\,dS+\int_{V}{g}\,dV=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
We consider an arbitrary volume. The volumetric heat generation per unit volume is assumed constant. Then Equation (1) can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
Where ${q_{\text{in}}}$, ${q_{\text{out}}}$, ${A_{\text{in}}}$, and ${A_{\text{out}}}$ are explained in \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD:rocTempSimp}. Assuming $ρ$, $C$, and $T$ are constant over the volume, which is true in our case by \hyperref[assumpCWTAT]{A:Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank}, \hyperref[assumpDWCoW]{A:Density-Water-Constant-over-Volume}, and \hyperref[assumpSHECoW]{A:Specific-Heat-Energy-Constant-over-Volume}, we have:

\begin{displaymath}
ρ C V \frac{\,dT}{\,dt}={q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V
\end{displaymath}
Using the fact that $ρ$=$m$/$V$, Equation (2) can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
m C \frac{\,dT}{\,dt}={q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V

\paragraph{Detailed derivation of the energy balance on water:}
\label{IM:eBalanceOnWtrDeriv}
To find the rate of change of ${T_{\text{W}}}$, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water in the tank ${V_{\text{W}}}$, which has mass ${m_{\text{W}}}$ and specific heat capacity, ${C_{\text{W}}}$. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the heating coil as ${q_{\text{C}}}$ (\hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil}), over area ${A_{\text{C}}}$. No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated (\hyperref[assumpPIT]{A:Perfect-Insulation-Tank}). Since the assumption is made that no internal heat is generated (\hyperref[assumpNIHGBW]{A:No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water}), $g=0$. Therefore, the equation for \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD:rocTempSimp} can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}={q_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}
\end{displaymath}
Using \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil} for ${q_{\text{C}}}$, this can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}={h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Dividing Equation (2) by ${m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}$, we obtain:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
By substituting ${τ_{\text{W}}}$ (from \hyperref[DD:balanceDecayRate]{DD:balanceDecayRate}), this can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{1}{{τ_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)

\subsubsection{Data Constraints}
\label{Sec:DataConstraints}
The \hyperref[Table:InDataConstraints]{Data Constraints Table} shows the data constraints on the input variables. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The column for software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.

\item[Correct:\phantomsection\label{correct}]{The outputs of the code have the properties described in \hyperref[Sec:CorSolProps]{Properties of a Correct Solution}.}
\item[Verifiable:\phantomsection\label{verifiable}]{The code is tested with complete verification and validation plan.}
\item[Understandable:\phantomsection\label{understandable}]{The code is modularized with complete module guide and module interface specification.}
\item[Reusable:\phantomsection\label{reusable}]{The code is modularized.}
\item[Maintainable:\phantomsection\label{maintainable}]{The traceability between requirements, assumptions, theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, unlikely changes, and modules is completely recorded in traceability matrices in the SRS and module guide.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Likely Changes}
\label{Sec:LCs}
This section lists the likely changes to be made to the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Day:\phantomsection\label{likeChgTCVOD}]{\hyperref[assumpTHCCoT]{A:Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Time} - The temperature of the heating coil will change over the course of the day, depending on the energy received from the sun.}
\item[Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Length:\phantomsection\label{likeChgTCVOL}]{\hyperref[assumpTHCCoL]{A:Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length} - The temperature of the heating coil will actually change along its length as the water within it cools.}
\item[Discharging-Tank:\phantomsection\label{likeChgDT}]{\hyperref[assumpCTNTD]{A:Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge} - The model currently only accounts for charging of the tank. That is, increasing the temperature of the water to match the temperature of the coil. A more complete model would also account for discharging of the tank.}
\item[Tank-Lose-Heat:\phantomsection\label{likeChgTLH}]{\hyperref[assumpPIT]{A:Perfect-Insulation-Tank} - Any real tank cannot be perfectly insulated and will lose heat.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Unlikely Changes}
\label{Sec:UCs}
This section lists the unlikely changes to be made to the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Water-Fixed-States:\phantomsection\label{unlikeChgWFS}]{\hyperref[assumpWAL]{A:Water-Always-Liquid} - It is unlikely for the change of water from liquid to a solid, or from liquid to gas to be considered.}
\item[No-Internal-Heat-Generation:\phantomsection\label{unlikeChgNIHG}]{\hyperref[assumpNIHGBW]{A:No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water} - Is used for the derivations of \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM:eBalanceOnWtr}.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}
\label{Sec:TraceMatrices}
The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an ``X'' should be modified as well. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatAvsA]{Tab:TraceMatAvsA} shows the dependencies of assumptions on the assumptions. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatAvsAll]{Tab:TraceMatAvsAll} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatRefvsRef]{Tab:TraceMatRefvsRef} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatAllvsR]{Tab:TraceMatAllvsR} shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models.

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. \hyperref[Figure:TraceGraphAvsA]{Fig:TraceGraphAvsA} shows the dependencies of assumptions on the assumptions. \hyperref[Figure:TraceGraphAvsAll]{Fig:TraceGraphAvsAll} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. \hyperref[Figure:TraceGraphRefvsRef]{Fig:TraceGraphRefvsRef} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. \hyperref[Figure:TraceGraphAllvsR]{Fig:TraceGraphAllvsR} shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models. \hyperref[Figure:TraceGraphAllvsAll]{Fig:TraceGraphAllvsAll} shows the dependencies of dependencies of assumptions, models, definitions, requirements, goals, and changes with each other.
