-- | The basic idea dicts that are used to construct the basis chunk database.
-- Every chunk added here is added to every new chunk database created that uses
--  the cdb constructor. This ensures that the information in these idea dicts
--  is always available in the chunk database.
basisIdeaDicts :: [IdeaDict]
basisIdeaDicts =
  -- | Actual IdeaDicts
  --  * doccon - General documentation related IdeaDicts. Included in the basis
  --             as it is data which all the cases studies use and is not specific
  --             to a particular case study.
  --  * prodtcon - A list of a few IdeaDicts that are terms related to software products.
  --              This is included in the basis as it can be used to describe
  --              any software, which each of the case study examples produce.
  --              For example, one of the chunks, `sciCompS`, can be used to describe
  --              all of the software that Drasil generates, since it is all scientific
  --              computing software.
  --  * educon - IdeaDict chunks with information about education. Included in the basis
  --            as each case study should provide information about the expected users,
  --            which usually means describing the expected education level in related
  --            fields.
  --  * compcon - Computing related IdeaDicts. Since all of the case studies are
  --              concerned with software, this is included in the basis as the
  --              computing chunks are relevant to all of them.
  doccon ++ prodtcon ++ educon ++ compcon ++

  --  * doccon' - A list of CommonIdeas that are added for the same purpose as `doccon`.

basisConceptChunks :: [ConceptChunk]
basisConceptChunks =
  -- | ConceptChunks
  --  * algorithm - A concept chunk that describes algorithms. This is included in the
  --                basis as algorithms are a commonly used concept in the case studies.
  --                but did not fit into the other lists
  --  * errMsg - Concept chunk defining an error message. Error messages are common in
  --             any software, so this is included in the basis.
  --  * program - A concept chunk defining a computer program. This is included 
  --              in the basis as all of the case studies are concerned with software.
  --  * srsDomains - SRS related concepts. These are included in the basis as every
  --                 case study should have a generated SRS, and these concepts would
  --                 be needed for that.
  --  * mathcon - Math concepts. Math is widespread throughout all of the case studies
  --              and scientific computing software in general, so it is included
  --              in the basis.
  [algorithm, errMsg, program] ++ srsDomains ++ mathcon

-- | The basis chunk database, which contains the basic idea dicts, concept chunks,
--  and units that are used in all of the case studies. This database is then added
-- to all of the new chunk databases created using the cdb constructor.
