[Formal Concept Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis) provides some mathematical grounding to creating a 'lattice' of knowledge. This [blog post](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/09/formal_concept_analysis.html) from 2013 is a nice introduction to the core ideas (the first bits are general and understandable, and then it goes deep into category theory to explain the rest; most other introductions take a deep dive into lattice theory to achieve the same thing - in both cases, being obscure to those without the necessary background.)  There's [February 2022 follow-up](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2022/02/concepts_and_profunctor_nuclei.html) that is even more hard-core, but also shows that generalizations of the ideas are useful too.

The basic idea is simple: any relation between a set of objects (here: the various quantities computed in a program) and attributes (such as having units, having a type, having a precision, having a symbol, etc) forms a relation. That relation induces a lattice of concepts. Which is exactly the kind of knowledge we're trying to capture!
