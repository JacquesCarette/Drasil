%% FILL THIS IN %%
\begin{quotation}
  Last year one of a couple vendors presented results after they tried to update
  an analysis from 40 years ago and because the analysis models are not well
  documented they resulted in different final conclusions which had the
  potential to significantly increase operating costs.  I've had to spend the
  last 3 months going over tracking down the impact of each new assumption in
  turn and testing them against available information to see how the original
  results were achieved.  I've found several design features that were credited
  in the original work but not well explained in one case and assumptions about
  how the software worked that were misleading in another.  Had this information
  been better documented a lot of wasted effort could have been avoided.

\vspace{.5cm}Where did $\tau{}_i$ come from?\vspace{.3cm}

Were $S_i$ and $P_i$ swapped?


\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau{}_i$ was not defined anywhere in the documents
\item Found with Drasil -- undefined symbols throw errors
\item Equation based on concepts -- symbols automatically retrieved

Problems arise when attempting to explain things to a machine.

\item What is each section contributing? %(in an artifact) --> New knowledge (assumps, reqs)? Building off previous towards a solution?
\item Why do we organize things a given way?
