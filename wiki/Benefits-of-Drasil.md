# Benefits of Drasil

Drasil's use of generative programming has a transformative impact on the development process. Here we collect examples demonstrating how Drasil's generative approach simplifies the development process, enhances code quality, and ensures the reliability of your projects. See [Quantifying Productivity and Ease of Use](Quantifying-Productivity-and-Ease-of-Use) for a similar discussion.

**[Cosmetic changes made easy](../issues/3772)**: Our generated code was missing an empty line between the header comment block and the start of the code. A one-line change fixed this issue; at the time of this change, this resulted in updates to 175 files, i.e. eliminating the need for 175 manual edits.

**[Streamlined LaTeX updates](../issues/3881)**: The rendering of the multiplication operator in LaTeX was updated, requiring only a 4-line change of Drasil code. This small adjustment resulted in approximately 1360 modifications across 67 files of generated code, showcasing the efficiency of Drasil’s generative approach.
