# Problem Description {#Sec:ProbDesc}

A system is needed to simulate 2D rigid body physics for use in game development in a simple, lightweight, fast, and portable manner, which will allow for the production of higher quality products. Creating a gaming physics library is a difficult task. Games need physics libraries that simulate objects acting under various physical conditions, while simultaneously being fast and efficient enough to work in soft real-time during the game. Developing a physics library from scratch takes a long period of time and is very costly, presenting barriers of entry which make it difficult for game developers to include physics in their products. There are a few free, open source and high quality [physics libraries](./SecoffShelfSolns.md#Sec:offShelfSolns) available to be used for consumer products.
