-- | For writing "sentences" via combining smaller elements
-- Sentences are made up of some known vocabulary of things:
-- - units (their visual representation)
-- - words (via String)
-- - special characters
-- - accented letters
-- - References to specific layout objects

(+:+) :: Sentence -> Sentence -> Sentence
EmptyS +:+ b = b

-- | Helper for concatenating two sentences with a comma and space between them.
sC :: Sentence -> Sentence -> Sentence
a `sC` b = a :+: S "," +:+ b

-- | Helper which concatenates two sentences using '+:+' then adds a period to

(+:+.) :: Sentence -> Sentence -> Sentence
a +:+. b = a +:+ b :+: S "."

-- | Helper which concatenates two sentences using '+:+' then adds a colon to

(+:) :: Sentence -> Sentence -> Sentence
a +: b = a +:+ b :+: S ":"
