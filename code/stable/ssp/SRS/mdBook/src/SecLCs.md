# Likely Changes {#Sec:LCs}

This section lists the likely changes to be made to the software.

<div id="LC_inhomogeneous"></div>

Calculate-Inhomogeneous-Soil-Layers: [A:Soil-Layer-Homogeneous](./SecAssumps.md#assumpSLH) - The system currently assumes the soil mass is homogeneous. In the future, calculations can be added for inconsistent soil properties throughout.

<div id="LC_seismic"></div>

Calculate-Seismic-Force: [A:Seismic-Force](./SecAssumps.md#assumpSF) - The system currently assumes no seismic force. In the future, calculations can be added for the presence of seismic force.

<div id="LC_external"></div>

Calculate-External-Force: [A:Surface-Load](./SecAssumps.md#assumpSL) - The system currently assumes no external forces. In the future, calculations can be added for an imposed surface load on the slope.
