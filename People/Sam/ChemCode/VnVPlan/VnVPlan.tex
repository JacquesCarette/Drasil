  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\cite{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
  that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
  the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
  inspection?}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Input Testing}

This section defines tests for inputting chemical equations from R1 of the SRS
\sjc{Add link}. \sjc{Justify the choice of these specific tests.}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item[T\refstepcounter{testnum}\thetestnum \label{test_valid_input}:]
    \textbf{Test for Valid Input}

    Control: Manual

    Initial State: \progname{} is started.

    Input: A representation of the equation
    $\ce{CH6} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{CO2} + \ce{H2O}$
    \cite{hamid_balancing_2019}.

    Output: The inputted chemical equation is stored in \progname{}.

    Test Case Derivation: In order for \progname{} to be useful, it needs to be
    able to receive a chemical equation from the user and store it to balance it
    later.

    How test will be performed: A debug statement will be added to display the
    stored chemical equation and this representation will be manually compared to
    the given input.

    Output: The inputted chemical equation is stored in \progname{}.

    Test Case Derivation: In order for \progname{} to be useful, it needs to be
    able to receive a chemical equation from the user and store it to balance it
    later.

      \ce{FeS}$$

    Output: The inputted chemical equation is stored in \progname{}.

    Test Case Derivation: In order for \progname{} to be useful, it needs to be
    able to receive a chemical equation from the user and store it to balance it

    Initial State: \progname{} is started.

    Input: A representation of the equation
    $\ce{Fe_{0.95}O} + \ce{O2} \rightarrow \ce{Fe2O3}$
    \cite{doubtnut_when_nodate}.

    Output: The inputted chemical equation is stored in \progname{}.

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
  format for the tests given below.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
  philosophy for test case selection.}
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item{test-id1\\}

  Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
    be automatic}

  Initial State:

  Input:

  Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

  Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

  How test will be performed:

  \item{test-id2\\}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
