\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Intro}
A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in signifcant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program (SSP). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{Sec:DocPurpose}
The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of SSP and the models that will be used to meet those requirements. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SSP. With the exception of system constraints in \hyperref[Sec:SysConstraints]{Section: System Constraints}, this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out \cite{parnasClements1986}, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to ``fake'' a rational design process.
\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
\label{Sec:ReqsScope}
The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) soil mass, composed of a single homogeneous layer with constant material properties. The soil mass is assumed to extend infinitely in the third dimension. The analysis will be at an instant in time; factors that may change the soil properties over time will not be considered.
\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:ReaderChars}
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate level 4 physics and undergraduate level 2 or higher solid mechanics. An understanding of soil mechanics would be an asset. The users of SSA can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in \hyperref[Sec:UserChars]{Section: User Characteristics}.
\subsection{Organization of Document}
\label{Sec:DocOrg}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor as well as Smith and Lai. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models} and trace back to find any additional information they require.
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved iteratively to perform a Morgenstern Price Analysis.
\section{General System Description}
\label{Sec:GenSysDesc}
This section provides general information about the system. It identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user characteristics, and lists the system constraints.
\subsection{System Context}
\label{Sec:SysContext}
\hyperref[Figure:sysCtxDiag]{Fig:sysCtxDiag} shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SSP). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/SSP/SystemContextFigure.png}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Figure:sysCtxDiag}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The interaction between the product and the user is through a user interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{User Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Provide the input data related to the soil layer(s) and water table (if applicable), ensuring no errors in the data entry}
\item{Ensure that consistent units are used for input variables}
\item{Ensure required software assumptions (\hyperref[Sec:Assumps]{Section: Assumptions}) are appropriate for any particular problem input to the software}
\end{itemize}
\item{SSP Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters  input instead of a floating point number}
\item{Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints}
\item{Identify the most likely failure surface within the possible input range}
\item{Find the factor of safety for the slope}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{Sec:UserChars}
The end user of SSP should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1 Calculus and Physics, and be familiar with soil and material properties, specifically effective cohesion, effective angle of friction, and unit weight.
\subsection{System Constraints}
\label{Sec:SysConstraints}
There are no system constraints.
\section{Specific System Description}
\label{Sec:SpecSystDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.
\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{Sec:ProbDesc}
SSA is a computer program developed to evaluate the factor of safety of a slope's slip surface and identify the critical slip surface of the slope, as well as the interslice normal force and shear force along the critical slip surface. It is intended to be used as an educational tool for introducing slope stability issues, and to facilitate the analysis and design of a safe slope.
\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}
\label{Sec:TermDefs}
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.
\begin{itemize}
\item[Factor of Safety:]The global stability of a surface in a slope
\item[Critical Slip Surface:]Slip surface of the slope that has the lowest global factor of safety, and therefore most likely to experience failure.
\item[Stress:]Forces that are exerted between planes internal to a larger body subject to external loading.
\item[Strain:]Stress forces that result in deformation of the body/plane.
\item[Normal Force:]A force applied perpendicular to the plane of the material.
\item[Shear Force:]A force applied parallel to the plane of the material.
\item[Plane Strain:]The resultant stresses in one of the directions of a 3 dimensional material can be approximated as 0. Results when the length of one dimension of the body dominates the others. Stresses in the dominant dimensions direction are the ones that can be approximated as 0.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Physical System Description}
\label{Sec:PhysSyst}
Analysis of the slope is performed by looking at properties of the slope as a series of slice elements. Some properties are interslice properties, and some are slice or slice base properties. The index convention for referencing which interslice or slice is being used is shown in \hyperref[Figure:IndexConvention]{Fig:IndexConvention}.
\begin{itemize}
\item[PS1:]Interslice properties convention is noted by j. The end interslice properties are usually not of interest, therefore use the interslice properties from $1\leq{}i\leq{}n-1$.
\item[PS2:]Slice properties convention is noted by $i$.
\end{itemize}
A free body diagram of the forces acting on the slice is displayed in \hyperref[Figure:ForceDiagram]{Fig:ForceDiagram}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/SSP/IndexConvention.png}
\caption{Index convention for numbering slice and interslice force variables}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/SSP/ForceDiagram.png}
\caption{Forces acting on a slice}
\label{Figure:ForceDiagram}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\label{Sec:GoalStmt}
Given the geometry of the water table, the geometry of the layers composing the plane of a slope, and the material properties of the layers, the goal statements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[GS1:]Evaluate the factor of safety along a given slip surface.
\item[GS2:]Identify the critical slip surface for the slope, with the lowest factor of safety.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\label{Sec:SolCharSpec}
The instance models that govern SSA are presented in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models}. The information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.

                                 Notes & For a soil under stress it will exert a shear resistive strength based on the Coulomb sliding law. The resistive shear is the maximum amount of shear a surface can experience while remaining rigid, analogous to a maximum normal force. In this model the resistive shear stress $τ$ is proportional to the product of the normal stress on the plane $σ$ with it's static friction in the angular form $\tan\left(φ'\right)={U_{t}}$. The $τ$ versus $σ$ relationship is not truly linear, but assuming the effective normal force is strong enough, it can be approximated with a linear fit (\hyperref[A:Surface-Base-Slice-between-Interslice-Straight-Lines]{A: Surface-Base-Slice-between-Interslice-Straight-Lines}) where the cohesion $c'$ represents the $τ$ intercept of the fitted line.

The mobilized shear force defined in \hyperref[GD:bsShrFEq]{GD: bsShrFEq} can be substituted into the definition of mobilized shear force based on the factor of safety, from \hyperref[GD:mobShr]{GD: mobShr} yielding equation (1) below:
\begin{displaymath}
\left(W_{i}-X_{i-1}+X_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-G_{i}+G_{i-1}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{{N'}_{i} \tan\left(φ'\right)+c' {ℓ_{b,i}}}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
An expression for the effective normal force, $N'$, can be derived by substituting the normal force equilibrium from \hyperref[GD:normForcEq]{GD: normForcEq} into the definition for effective normal force from \hyperref[GD:resShearWO]{GD: resShearWO}. This results in equation (2):
\begin{displaymath}
{N'}_{i}=\left(W_{i}-X_{i-1}+X_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-G_{i}+G_{i-1}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-{U_{b,i}}
\end{displaymath}
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1) gives:
\begin{displaymath}
\left(W_{i}-X_{i-1}+X_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-G_{i}+G_{i-1}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{\left(\left(W_{i}-X_{i-1}+X_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-G_{i}+G_{i-1}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-{U_{b,i}}\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)+c' {ℓ_{b,i}}}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
Since the interslice shear force $X$ and interslice normal force $G$ are unknown, they are separated from the other terms as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
\left(W_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{\left(\left(W_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \cos\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-{K_{c}} W_{i}-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)+Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-{U_{b,i}}\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)+c' {ℓ_{b,i}}}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
Applying assumptions \hyperref[A:Seismic-Force]{A: Seismic-Force} and \hyperref[A:Surface-Load]{A: Surface-Load}, which state that the earthquake load factor and the imposed surface load, respectively, are zero, allows for further simplification as shown below:
\begin{displaymath}
\left(W_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{\left(\left(W_{i}+{U_{t,i}} \cos\left(β_{i}\right)\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-H_{i}+H_{i-1}+{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-{U_{b,i}}\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)+c' {ℓ_{b,i}}}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
The definitions of \hyperref[GD:resShearWO]{GD: resShearWO} and \hyperref[GD:mobShearWO]{GD: mobShearWO} are present in this equation, and thus can be replaced by $R_{i}$ and $T_{i}$, respectively:
\begin{displaymath}
T_{i}+\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{R_{i}+\left(\left(-X_{i-1}+X_{i}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
The interslice shear force $X$ can be expressed in terms of the interslice normal force $G$ using \hyperref[A:Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear]{A: Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear} and \hyperref[GD:normShrR]{GD: normShrR}, resulting in:
\begin{displaymath}
T_{i}+\left(-λ f_{i-1} G_{i-1}+λ f_{i} G_{i}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)=\frac{R_{i}+\left(\left(-λ f_{i-1} G_{i-1}+λ f_{i} G_{i}\right) \cos\left(α_{i}\right)+\left(-G_{i}+G_{i-1}\right) \sin\left(α_{i}\right)\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)}{{F_{S}}}
\end{displaymath}
Rearranging yields the following:
\begin{displaymath}
G_{i} \left(\left(λ f_{i} \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-\sin\left(α_{i}\right)\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)-\left(λ f_{i} \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\cos\left(α_{i}\right)\right) {F_{S}}\right)=G_{i-1} \left(\left(λ f_{i-1} \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-\sin\left(α_{i}\right)\right) \tan\left(φ'\right)-\left(λ f_{i-1} \sin\left(α_{i}\right)+\cos\left(α_{i}\right)\right) {F_{S}}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{i}-R_{i}
\end{displaymath}
The definitions for $Φ$ and $Ψ$ from \hyperref[DD:convertFunc1]{DD: convertFunc1} and \hyperref[DD:convertFunc2]{DD: convertFunc2} simplify the above to equation (3):
\begin{displaymath}
G_{i} Φ_{i}=Ψ_{i-1} G_{i-1} Φ_{i-1}+{F_{S}} T_{i}-R_{i}
\end{displaymath}
Versions of equation (3) instantiated for slices 1 to $n$ are shown below:
\begin{displaymath}
G_{1} Φ_{1}=Ψ_{0} G_{0} Φ_{0}+{F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
G_{2} Φ_{2}=Ψ_{1} G_{1} Φ_{1}+{F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
G_{3} Φ_{3}=Ψ_{2} G_{2} Φ_{2}+{F_{S}} T_{3}-R_{3}
\end{displaymath}
...
\begin{displaymath}
G_{n-2} Φ_{n-2}=Ψ_{n-3} G_{n-3} Φ_{n-3}+{F_{S}} T_{n-2}-R_{n-2}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
G_{n-1} Φ_{n-1}=Ψ_{n-2} G_{n-2} Φ_{n-2}+{F_{S}} T_{n-1}-R_{n-1}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
G_{n} Φ_{n}=Ψ_{n-1} G_{n-1} Φ_{n-1}+{F_{S}} T_{n}-R_{n}
\end{displaymath}
Applying \hyperref[A:Edge-Slices]{A: Edge-Slices}, which says that $G_{0}$ and $G_{n}$ are zero, results in the following special cases: equation (8) for the first slice:
\begin{displaymath}
G_{1} Φ_{1}={F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}
\end{displaymath}
and equation (9) for the $n$th slice:
\begin{displaymath}
-\left(\frac{{F_{S}} T_{n}-R_{n}}{Ψ_{n-1}}\right)=G_{n-1} Φ_{n-1}
\end{displaymath}
Substituting equation (8) into equation (4) yields equation (10):
\begin{displaymath}
G_{2} Φ_{2}=Ψ_{1} \left({F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}
\end{displaymath}
which can be substituted into equation (5) to get equation (11):
\begin{displaymath}
G_{3} Φ_{3}=Ψ_{2} \left(Ψ_{1} \left({F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{3}-R_{3}
\end{displaymath}
and so on until equation (12) is obtained from equation (7):
\begin{displaymath}
G_{n-1} Φ_{n-1}=Ψ_{n-2} \left(Ψ_{n-3} \left(Ψ_{1} \left({F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{n-2}-R_{n-2}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{n-1}-R_{n-1}
\end{displaymath}
equation (9) can then be substituted into the left-hand side of equation (12), resulting in:
\begin{displaymath}
-\left(\frac{{F_{S}} T_{n}-R_{n}}{Ψ_{n-1}}\right)=Ψ_{n-2} \left(Ψ_{n-3} \left(Ψ_{1} \left({F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{n-2}-R_{n-2}\right)+{F_{S}} T_{n-1}-R_{n-1}
\end{displaymath}
This can be rearranged by multiplying boths sides by $Ψ_{n-1}$ and then distributing the multiplication of each $Ψ$ over addition to obtain:
\begin{displaymath}
-\left({F_{S}} T_{n}-R_{n}\right)=Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{1} \left({F_{S}} T_{1}-R_{1}\right)+Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{2} \left({F_{S}} T_{2}-R_{2}\right)+Ψ_{n-1} \left({F_{S}} T_{n-1}-R_{n-1}\right)
\end{displaymath}
The multiplication of the $Ψ$ terms can be further distributed over the subtractins, resulting in the equation having terms that each either contain an $R$ or a $T$. The equation can then be rearranged so terms containing an $R$ are on one side of the equality, and terms containing a $T$ are on the other. The multiplication by the factor of safety is common to all of the $T$ terms, and thus can be factored out, resulting in:
\begin{displaymath}
{F_{S}} \left(Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{1} T_{1}+Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{2} T_{2}+Ψ_{n-1} T_{n-1}+T_{n}\right)=Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{1} R_{1}+Ψ_{n-1} Ψ_{n-2} Ψ_{2} R_{2}+Ψ_{n-1} R_{n-1}+R_{n}
\end{displaymath}
Isolating the factor of safety on the left-hand side and using compact notation for the products and sums yields equation (13), which can also be seen in \hyperref[IM:fctSfty]{IM: fctSfty}:
\begin{displaymath}
{F_{S}}=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{v=1}^{n-1}{R_{v} \displaystyle\prod_{u=i}^{n-1}{Ψ_{u}}}+R_{n}}{\displaystyle\sum_{v=1}^{n-1}{T_{v} \displaystyle\prod_{u=i}^{n-1}{Ψ_{u}}}+T_{n}}
\end{displaymath}
${F_{S}}$ depends on the unknowns $λ$ (\hyperref[IM:nrmShrFor]{IM: nrmShrFor}) and $G$ (\hyperref[IM:intsliceFs]{IM: intsliceFs}).

From the moment equilibrium of \hyperref[GD:momentEql]{GD: momentEql} with the primary assumption for the Morgenstern-Price method of \hyperref[A:Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear]{A: Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear} and associated definition \hyperref[GD:normShrR]{GD: normShrR} equation equation (9) can be derived:
\begin{displaymath}
0=-G_{i} \left(z_{i}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)+G_{i-1} \left(z_{i-1}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)-H_{i} \left(z_{i}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)+H_{i-1} \left(z_{i-1}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)-λ \frac{b_{i}}{2} \left(G_{i} f_{i}+G_{i-1} f_{i-1}\right)+\frac{{K_{c}} W_{i} h_{i}}{2}-{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right) h_{i}-Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right) h_{i}
\end{displaymath}
Rearranging the equation in terms of $λ$ leads to equation (10):
\begin{displaymath}
λ=\frac{-G_{i} \left(z_{i}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)+G_{i-1} \left(z_{i-1}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)-H_{i} \left(z_{i}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)+H_{i-1} \left(z_{i-1}-\frac{b_{i}}{2} \tan\left(α_{i}\right)\right)+\frac{{K_{c}} W_{i} h_{i}}{2}-{U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right) h_{i}-Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right) h_{i}}{\frac{b_{i}}{2} \left(G_{i} f_{i}+G_{i-1} f_{i-1}\right)}
\end{displaymath}
Taking a summation of each slice, and applying the boundary condition that $G_{0}$ and $G_{n}$ are equal to $0$, and removing the seismic and external forces due to \hyperref[A:Seismic-Force]{A: Seismic-Force} and \hyperref[A:Surface-Load]{A: Surface-Load}, a general equation for the constant $λ$ is developed in equation (11), also found in \hyperref[IM:nrmShrFor]{IM: nrmShrFor}:
\begin{displaymath}
λ_{i}=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}{b_{i} \left(SpencerFixme1Please+SpencerFixme2Please\right) \tan\left(α_{i}\right)+h_{i} \left({K_{c}} W_{i}-2 {U_{t,i}} \sin\left(β_{i}\right)-2 Q_{i} \sin\left(ω_{i}\right)\right)}}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}{b_{i} \left(G_{i} f_{i}+G_{i-1} f_{i-1}\right)}}
\end{displaymath}
equation (11) for $λ$, is a function of the unknown interslice normal force $G$ \hyperref[IM:intsliceFs]{IM: intsliceFs}.

Where $R$ and $T$ are the resistive and mobile shear of the slice, without the influence of interslice forces $G$ and $X$, as defined in \hyperref[GD:resShearWO]{GD: resShearWO} and \hyperref[GD:mobShearWO]{GD: mobShearWO} Making use of the constants, and with full equations found below in equation (19) and equation (20) respectively, then equation (18) can be simplified to equation (21), also seen in \hyperref[IM:intsliceFs]{IM: intsliceFs}:
\begin{displaymath}
Φ_{i}=\left(λ f_{i} \cos\left(α_{i}\right)-\sin\left(α_{i}\right)\right) \tan\left({φ'}_{i}\right)-\left(λ f_{i} \sin\left(α_{i}\right)-\cos\left(α_{i}\right)\right) {F_{S}}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
Ψ_{i}=\left(λ f_{i} \cos\left(α_{i+1}\right)-\sin\left(α_{i+1}\right)\right) \tan\left({φ'}_{i}\right)-\left(λ f_{i} \sin\left(α_{i+1}\right)-\cos\left(α_{i+1}\right)\right) {F_{S}}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
G_{i}=\frac{Ψ_{i-1} G_{i-1}+{F_{S}} T_{i}-R_{i}}{Φ_{i}}
\end{displaymath}
The constants $Ψ$ and $Φ$ described in equation (20) and equation (19) are functions of the unknowns: the interslice normal/shear force ratio $λ$ (\hyperref[IM:nrmShrFor]{IM: nrmShrFor}) and the factor of safety ${F_{S}}$ (\hyperref[IM:fctSfty]{IM: fctSfty}).

\subsubsection{Data Constraints}
\label{Sec:DataConstraints}
\hyperref[Table:InDataConstraints]{Table:InDataConstraints} and \hyperref[Table:OutDataConstraints]{Table:OutDataConstraints} show the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.

\section{Requirements}
\label{Sec:Requirements}
This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the software is expected to complete, and the non-functional requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{Sec:FRs}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Read-and-Store:\phantomsection\label{readAndStore}]Read the input file and store the data. Necessary input data summarized in \hyperref[Table:inDataTable]{Table:inDataTable}.
\item[Generate-Critical-Slip-Surfaces:\phantomsection\label{generateCSS}]Generate potential critical slip surfaces for the input slope.
\item[Test-Slip-Surfaces:\phantomsection\label{testSlipSrf}]Test the slip surfaces to determine if they are physically realizable based on a set of pass or fail criteria.
\item[Prepare-Slip-Surfaces:\phantomsection\label{prepareSlipS}]Prepare the slip surfaces for a method of slices or limit equilibrium analysis.
\item[Calculate-Factors-of-Safety:\phantomsection\label{calculateFS}]Calculate the factors of safety of the slip surfaces.
\item[Rank-and-Weight-Slopes:\phantomsection\label{rankSlope}]Rank and weight the slopes based on their factor of safety, such that a slip surface with a smaller factor of safety has a larger weighting.
\item[Generate-New-Critical-Slip-Surfaces:\phantomsection\label{generateCSS'}]Generate new potential critical slip surfaces based on previously analysed slip surfaces with low factors of safety.
\item[Repeat-Find-Factor-of-Safety:\phantomsection\label{repeatFindFS}]Repeat \hyperref[testSlipSrf]{FR: Test-Slip-Surfaces}, \hyperref[prepareSlipS]{FR: Prepare-Slip-Surfaces}, \hyperref[calculateFS]{FR: Calculate-Factors-of-Safety}, \hyperref[rankSlope]{FR: Rank-and-Weight-Slopes}, and \hyperref[generateCSS']{FR: Generate-New-Critical-Slip-Surfaces} until the minimum factor of safety remains approximately the same over a predetermined number of repetitions. Identify the slip surface that generates the minimum factor of safety as the critical slip surface.
\item[Prepare-Critical-Slip-Surface:\phantomsection\label{prepareCSS}]Prepare the critical slip surface for method of slices or limit equilibrium analysis.
\item[Calculate-Final-Factor-of-Safety:\phantomsection\label{calculateFS'}]Calculate the factor of safety of the critical slip surface using the Morgenstern Price method.
\item[Display-Graph:\phantomsection\label{displayGraph}]Display the critical slip surface graphically. Display the the value of the factor of safety.
\end{itemize}
\begin{longtable}{l l l}
\toprule
Symbol & Unit & Name
\\
\midrule
\endhead
$(x,y)$ & m & cartesian position coordinates
\\
$c'$ & Pa & effective cohesion
\\
$φ'$ & ${}^{\circ}$ & effective angle of friction
\\
$γ$ & $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^{3}}$ & dry unit weight
\\
${γ_{Sat}}$ & $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^{3}}$ & saturated unit weight
\\
${γ_{w}}$ & $\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^{3}}$ & unit weight of water

\caption{Required Inputs}
\label{Table:inDataTable}
\end{longtable}
\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{Sec:NFRs}
SSA is intended to be an educational tool, so accuracy and performance are not priorities.  Rather, the non-functional requirement priorities are correctness, understandability, reusability, and maintainability.
\section{Likely Changes}
\label{Sec:LCs}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Calculate-Inhomogeneous-Soil-Layers:\phantomsection\label{LC_inhomogeneous}]\hyperref[A:Soil-Layer-Homogeneous]{A: Soil-Layer-Homogeneous} - The system currently assumes the different layers of the soil are homogeneous. In the future, calculations can be added for inconsistent soil properties throughout.
\end{itemize}
\section{Unlikely Changes}
\label{Sec:UCs}
If changes were to be made with regard to the following, a different algorithm would be needed.
\begin{itemize}
\item[Normal-And-Shear-Linear-Only:\phantomsection\label{UC_normshearlinear}]Changes related to \hyperref[A:Soil-Layers-Isotropic]{A: Soil-Layers-Isotropic} and \hyperref[A:Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear]{A: Interslice-Norm-Shear-Forces-Linear} are not possible due to the dependency of the calculations on the linear relationship between interslice normal and shear forces.
\item[2D-Analysis-Only:\phantomsection\label{UC_2donly}]\hyperref[A:Effective-Norm-Stress-Large]{A: Effective-Norm-Stress-Large} allows for 2D analysis with these models only because stress along z-direction is zero. These models do not take into account stress in the z-direction, and therefore cannot be without manipulation to attempt 3d analysis.
\end{itemize}
\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}
\label{Sec:AuxConstants}
There are no auxiliary constants.
