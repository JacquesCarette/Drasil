# Goal Statements {#Sec:GoalStmt}

Given the kinematic properties, and forces (including any collision forces) applied on a set of rigid bodies, the goal statements are:

<div id="linearGS"></div>

Determine-Linear-Properties: Determine their new positions and velocities over a period of time.

<div id="angularGS"></div>

Determine-Angular-Properties: Determine their new orientations and angular velocities over a period of time.
