\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr.\ Jacques Carette.
Through his invested time, effort, and guidance, I was able to grow as a
researcher, explore my ideas, and learn more than I could have hoped.
Additionally, I would like to Dr.\ Spencer Smith for the encouraging discourse,
feedback, and advice in our Drasil meetings. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Dr.\ Wolfram Kahl for his advice and feedback on my work. I would also like to
thank Dong Chen for his help with editing my thesis. Of course, I would also
like to thank the Drasil research team present and past for the memories and
fruitful discussion.

I would also like to thank my parents Yakup and Christina, my brother Daniel,
and my aunt Leila for their endless love and support during my education.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends for always being there for me. In
particular, I would like to thank my best friend and partner Hala.

I could not have done this without any one of you.
