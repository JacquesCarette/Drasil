Figure 1: Poster Mockup (Not to scale)

1. Sick of sfwr artifacts falling out of sync?
2. Figure: Generate all the things
3. Abstract (Research Prob)
3.1 Figure: Knowledge Duplication
3.2 Figure: Motivation (see Ernie pres 3, slide 6)
C. Contact info

4. Figure: Rational Design Process
5. Improving software quality through rational design process / Faking it
6. Goals/Contributions? - Framework, Knowledge base, 
  (maybe bring some advantages in here?), ??
6.1 Figure: Knowledge Capture?

7. Practical example-driven approach -- Can be moved up if need more space
8. Figure: Tree (recipe trunk, knowledge roots, artifact leaves) -- New version
9. Figure: Chunk Hierarchy
10. Figure: Abstraction -- Need a new, cleaned up version
11. Figure? DSLs all the way down to Haskell (Simplified view)

13. Data.Drasil (SI Units, etc.)
13.1 Figure: SI Units?
14. Figure: Incorporation of GOOL / Generating code in multiple languages
15. Figure: Document generation in HTML/LaTeX 
16. Disadvantages
  - High initial time investment
  - Adding knowledge is not simple; Requires domain experts
17. Advantages 
  - internal (inter- and intra-artifact) consistency; great for certification
  - common knowledge base - promotes reuse; shared across many projects
  - pervasive bugs
R. References (move wherever there is space)
