    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘QuantityDict’
      Expected: Maybe QuantityDict
        Actual: Maybe a
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        a pattern with constructor: Chunk :: forall a. a -> Chunk,
        in a pattern binding in
             a 'do' block
        at app/Main.hs:21:4-19
    • In a stmt of a 'do' block: pure expectedQd
      In the expression:
        do (Chunk expectedQd) <- lookup u cdb
           pure expectedQd
      In an equation for ‘retrieveQD’:
          retrieveQD u cdb
            = do (Chunk expectedQd) <- lookup u cdb
                 pure expectedQd
    • Relevant bindings include
        expectedQd :: a (bound at app/Main.hs:21:10)

22 |   pure expectedQd
