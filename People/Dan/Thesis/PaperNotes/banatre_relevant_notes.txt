Generative Programming from a DSL Viewpoint - Charles Consel
------------------------------------------------------------

- Mentions cross-cutting concerns and DSL general use cases. Good for bg

------------------------------------------------------------
Generative Programming from an AOP/CBSE Perspective - Mira Mezini & Klaus Ostermann
------------------------------------------------------------

- Has great citations
- Focused on AOP, but some interesting comments on decomposition and model-relations
  specifically re: cross-cutting concerns and model projections
- "Software decomposition techniques so far including OO decomp are weak at
  supporting multi-view decomposition"
- Gets into formal definitions of model projections
- Pro AOP and GPLs, anti-DSL

Overview of Generative Software Development - Krzysztof Czarnecki
------------------------------------------------------------

- Lots of great stuff - advocates shifting to software family generation
- Good references to check out
- "Domain engineering supplies application engineering with the reusable assets
  whereas application engineering feeds back new requirements to domain engineering"
  - Correlates well to our interation & refinement work, since it was iterating
    on applications by refining the domain and vice versa.  
- "Domain engineering can be applied at different levels of maturity... establish
  a common terminology among different... teams... introduce a common architecture
  for a set of systems... provide a set of components...the assembly of these
  components can be partially or fully automated using generators and/or
  configurators... the generated products may also contain non-software artifacts,
  such as test plans, manuals, tutorials, maintenance guidelines, etc."
  - I'd argue those are all non-code software artifacts, not non-software artifacts.
- What's the Draco model of domains and software generation? (TODO: Read the paper)
- Lots of discussion on DSLs and existing generative tech
- MDD primer - "aims at capturing every important aspect of a software system 
  through appropriate models" -- emphasis is really on the code
- MDA -> Devs express applications independent of specific implementation platforms
  - Seems to be one level above code (doesn't target other softifacts)
  - Models are expressed using UML and framework uses Object Management Group standards 
  - MDA efforts focused on achieving platform independence where GSD addresses 
    both technical and application-domain variability
- Contains a useful figure (9) that shows MDA as a subset of GSD.

Generative Programming from a Post Object-Oriented Programming Viewpoint 
  - Shigeru Chiba
------------------------------------------------------------

- Not all that relevant. A few sentences stand out, but mentions generative
  programming, AOP, and DSLs as possible future avenues to overcome mentioned 
  issues

Understanding Generative Programming - From (meta) objects to aspects 
  - Pierre Cointe

- "Generative Programming (GP) is an attempt to manufacture software components
  in an automated way by developing programs that synthesize other programs."
- Good resources on GP -- Czarnecki 2000, Batory et al., 
- Czarnecki 2000 - "The transition to automated manufacturing in software 
  requires two steps. First we need to move our focus from engineering single 
  systems to engineering families of systems - this will allow us to come up 
  with the 'right' implementation of components. Second, we need to automate 
  the assembly of the implementation components using generators"
- "Generative Programming (GP) is an attempt to provide a variety of approaches 
  and techniques to manufacture sofware components in an automated way by 
  developing programs that synthesize other programs"
- "The reflective approach makes the assumption that it is possible to separate 
  in a given application its why expressed at the base level from its how 
  expressed at the metalevel"
