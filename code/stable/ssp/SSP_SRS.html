<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. For an unstable slope this can cause instability in the form of soil/rock movement. The effects of soil/rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in signifcant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analyzing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability Analysis (SSA) program. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the organization of the document, and the characteristics of the intended reader.
</p>
<a id="Sec:DocPurpose">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Purpose of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The SSA program determines the critical slip surface, and its respective factor of safety as a method of assessing the stability of a slope design. The program is intended to be used as an educational tool for introducing slope stability issues, and will facilitate the analysis and design of a safe slope.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to &quot;fake&quot; a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:ReqsScope">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Scope of Requirements
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a 2 dimensional slope, composed of homogeneous soil layers. Given the appropriate inputs, the code for SSA is intended to identify the most likely failure surface within the possible input range, and find the factor of safety for the slope as well as displacement of soil that will occur on the slope.

<a id="Sec:ReaderChars">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Characteristics of Intended Reader
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
Reviewers of this documentation should have a strong knowledge in solid mechanics. The reviewers should also have an understanding of undergraduate level 4 physics. The users of SSA can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in <a href=#Sec:UserChars>User Characteristics</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Organization of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor as well as Smith and Lai. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in <a href=#Sec:IMs>Instance Models</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved iteratively to perform a Morgenstern Price Analysis.

<h4>
Terminology and Definitions
</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.
</p>
<div class="list">
<p>
Factor of Safety: The global stability of a surface in a slope
</p>
<p>
Critical Slip Surface: Slip surface of the slope that has the lowest global factor of safety, and therefore most likely to experience failure.
</p>
<p>
Stress: Forces that are exerted between planes internal to a larger body subject to external loading.
</p>
<p>
Strain: Stress forces that result in deformation of the body/plane.
</p>
<p>
Normal Force: A force applied perpendicular to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Shear Force: A force applied parallel to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Tension: A stress that causes displacement of the body away from its center.
</p>
<p>
Compression: A stress that causes displacement of the body towards its center.
</p>
<p>
Plane Strain: The resultant stresses in one of the directions of a 3 dimensional material can be approximated as 0. Results when the length of one dimension of the body dominates the others. Stresses in the dominate dimensions direction are the ones that can be approximated as 0.

A6: Slice to base normal and shear forces have a linear relationship, dependent on the factor of safety <em>FS</em>, and the Coulomb sliding law.
</p>
<p>
A7: The stress - strain curve for interslice relationships is linear with a constant slope.
</p>
<p>
A8: The slope and slip surface extends far into and out of the geometry (z coordinate). This implies plane strain conditions, making 2D analysis appropriate.
</p>
<p>
A9: The effective normal stress is large enough that the resistive shear to effective normal stress relationship can be approximated as a linear relationship.
</p>
<p>
A10: The surface and base of a slice between interslice nodes are approximated as straight lines.

For a soil under stress it will exert a shear resistive strength based on the Coulomb sliding law. The resistive shear is the maximum amount of shear a surface can experience while remaining rigid, analogous to a maximum normal force. In this model the resistive shear stress <em>&tau;</em> is proportional to the product of the normal stress on the plane <em>&sigma;</em> with it's static friction in the angular form tan(<em>&phiv;&prime;</em>) = <em>U<sub>t</sub></em>. The <em>&tau;</em> versus <em>&sigma;</em> relationship is not truly linear, but assuming the effective normal force is strong enough it can be approximated with a linear fit (A9) where the cohesion <em>c&prime;</em> represents the <em>&tau;</em> intercept of the fitted line.

For interslice surfaces the stiffness constants and displacements refer to an unrotated coordinate system, <em>&delta;</em> of GD9.

For basal surfaces the stiffness constants and displacements refer to a system rotated for the base angle alpha (DD5). To analyze the effect of force-displacement relationships occurring on both basal and interslice surfaces of an element <em>i</em> they must reference the same coordinate system.

The Morgenstern Price method is a vertical slice, limit equilibrium slope stability analysis method. Analysis is performed by breaking the assumed failure surface into a series of vertical slices of mass. Static equilibrium analysis using two force equilibrium, and one moment equation as in T2. The problem is statically indeterminate with only these 3 equations and one constitutive equation (the Mohr Coulomb shear strength of T3) so the assumption of GD5 is used. Solving for force equilibrium allows definitions of all forces in terms of the physical properties of DD1 to DD9, as done in DD10, DD11.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The values of the interslice normal force <em>E</em> the interslice normal/shear force ratio <em>&lambda;</em>, and the Factor of Safety (<em>FS</em>), are unknown. Equations for the unknowns are written in terms of only the values in DD1 to DD9, the values of <em>R</em>, and <em>T</em> in DD10 and DD11, and each other. The relationships between the unknowns are non linear, and therefore explicit equations cannot be derived and an iterative solutions method is required.

Using the known input assumption of A2, the force variable definitions of DD1 to DD8 on the left side of the equations can be solved for. The only unknown in the variables to solve for the stiffness values from DD14 is the displacements. Therefore taking the equation from each slice a set of 2&#8239;<em>n</em> equations, with 2&#8239;<em>n</em> unknown displacements in the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions of each slice can be derived. Solutions for the displacements of each slice can then be found. The use of displacement in the definition of the stiffness values makes the equation implicit, which means an iterative solution method, with an initial guess for the displacements in the stiffness values is required.

RFEM analysis can also be used to calculate the factor of safety for the slope. For a slice element <em>i</em> the displacements <em>&delta;x</em> and <em>&delta;y</em>, are solved from the system of equations in IM4. The definition of <em>&epsilon;</em> as the rotation of the displacement vector <em>&delta;</em> is seen in GD9. This is used to find the displacements of the slice parallel to the base of the slice <em>&delta;u</em> in equation (24) and normal to the base of the slice <em>&delta;v</em> in equation (25).

The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.
