# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar Water Heating System with no Phase Change Material provide a novel way of storing energy.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems with no phase change material The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System With No Phase Change Material (SWHSNoPCM) based on the original, manually created version of [SWHSNoPCM](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/master/CaseStudies/noPCM/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
