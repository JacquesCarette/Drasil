In \Cref{chap:lang-division}, we discussed Drasil's single mathematical
expression language and split it into three variants, each specialized for their
intended usage context. As a result, users don't need to worry about using terms
inapplicable in various contexts. However, an issue remains with expressions:
Drasil's standard mathematical language (\Expr{}) remains untyped, and thus
Drasil does not detect malformed expressions, allowing users to make errors that
affect both the problem descriptions in the \acs{srs} and the usability of
generated software. In this chapter, we will focus on mitigating expression
typing issues for the most important context: concrete theories used for code
generation.

\section{Expressions, Instance Models, and Data Definitions}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:expressions-instance-models-and-data-definitions}

To generate code, Drasil's code generator relies on a series of concrete
theories as part of its input. There are two kinds of theories that the code
generator uses from the abstracted \acs{srs} template: instance models and data
definitions. Data definitions are, as the name suggests, concrete symbol
definitions using expressions (similar to the \EquationalModel{} \ModelKind{}
variant, discussed in \Cref{chap:modelkinds}). On the other hand, instance
models may contain data definitions or any of the other applicable \ModelKinds{}
variants (discussed in \Cref{chap:more-theory-kinds}, albeit currently
limited\footnote{For our purposes, it's enough to assume that they can expose
any number of expressions usable in code generation.}). For the expressions they
expose/form to be usable in code generation, the expressions must be
representable in \acs{gool} somehow\footnote{Since all code generation for
Drasil currently goes through \acs{gool}.}. Thanks to \Cref{chap:lang-division},
\Expr{} has become the expression language that currently limits mathematical
expressions in both instance models and data definitions to ones with definite
values that can be directly computed on pencil and paper, and in most modern
programming languages. However, translatability to \acs{gool} does not
necessarily mean that all the expressions are actually coherent and usable. At
the moment, it is possible to give Drasil's instance models and data definitions
invalid \Expr{}s and have Drasil generate code.

\pseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTyping{}

Take \refCurrentLandPosIMQD{} for example. The defining expression of
\(p_\text{land}\), \inlineHs{E.landPosExpr}, is of type \Expr{} and limited to
terms that can be naively translated to \acs{gool} without external knowledge.
If we were to change the defining expression to something incoherent (such as
\(1 + \texttt{``Drasil''}\)\footnote{The sum of the number 1 and string
``Drasil''.}, \refPseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTyping{}), we end up with (a) an
algorithm that doesn't exactly make sense, and (b) a generated software source
code that does what we wanted it to do
(\refPseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTypingJavaCode{}), but which isn't actually
compilable software (\refPseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTypingJavaCodeCompErr{}).
Despite the example's simplicity, assuming it was derived from other theories
that somehow went awry, then we should have caught the type error before we
generated code.

\pseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTypingJavaCode{}

\pseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTypingJavaCodeCompErr{}

\refPseudoExampleLandPosQDBadTypingJavaCodeCompErr{} provides us with a
meaningful error message: ``String cannot be converted to double.'' To fix this
issue, we would need to change the string to something valid, a number at least
because Java also performs a secret cast, interpreting the \(1\) as a double,
despite our encoding having it be an integer. All code Drasil generates should
be reliably compilable and usable, and all errors should be noted as Drasil is
used. The issue here lies in that the initial expression was incoherent (and the
Java code was \textit{ill-typed}). So, now, how can we avoid this situation
altogether? We need all expressions to be \textit{well-typed}. However, Drasil
doesn't have a working understanding of what it means for expressions to be
well-typed.

Ultimately, the issue lies in that \Expr{} is not type-safe \cite{Harper2016}
and that we don't capture any knowledge about what it means for expressions to
be \textit{well-typed}. In other words, \Expr{} is not closed under
\textit{preservation}\footnote{\textit{Preservation} is a rule that evaluation
of a language should preserve typing of expressions \cite{Harper2016}.} and
\textit{progress}\footnote{\textit{Progress} is a rule that says that any
well-typed expression is either a value or something that can be further
evaluated \cite{Harper2016}.} \cite{Harper2016}, which means that during
evaluation\footnote{Of course, ``evaluation'' here is also related to the
evaluation of \acs{gool}-generated code.} of expressions, illegal instructions
and type mismatches are possible. Thus, we must make \Expr{} type-safe.

\section{Type-Safe Expressions}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:type-safe-expressions}

To make \Expr{} type-safe, we must build a type system for it so that we can
obtain information about which \Expr{} terms are coherent/valid or not. A system
of typing rules that dictate what well-typed expressions will allow us to
determine which expressions are well-typed.

\subsection{Example: A \textquotedblleft{}Simple\textquotedblright{} Language}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:type-safe-expressions:subsec:example-a-simple-language}

For example, if we had a small ``simple'' language, \(\bb{L}\), that contains
integer and boolean values, with functionality for addition, ``less than''
comparison, conjunction, and if-then-else (ternary operators)\footnote{Assume
the definitions of the functions be total and understood/used under the
conventional sense that mathematicians so often do.}, we might write the syntax
inductively, as follows\footnote{Note that I will be using a traditional
math-oriented syntax definition here, but if we were to transcribe it in
Haskell, we may find differences.}:

\begin{longtable}{ r c c l}
      \(\bb{L}(l)\) & ::=       & \(n\)                                                        & Integers (where \(n\) is any integer) \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \texttt{true}                                                & True                                  \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \texttt{false}                                               & False                                 \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \(l_1\ \texttt{+}\ l_2\)                                     & Addition                              \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \(l_1\ \texttt{<}\ l_2\)                                     & ``Less than'' comparison              \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \(l_1\ \texttt{\land}\ l_2\)                                 & Conjunction                           \\
                    & \(\vert\) & \(\texttt{if}\ l_1\ \texttt{then}\ l_2\ \texttt{else}\ l_3\) & if-then-else (ternary ``if'')         \\
\end{longtable}

Now, we can form expressions, such as:

\begin{equation}
      10
      \label{ex:sl:s:good1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      23 + (400\ \texttt{+}\ 4000)
      \label{ex:sl:s:good2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \texttt{if}\ \texttt{true}\ \texttt{then}\ 95\ \texttt{else}\ 96
      \label{ex:sl:s:good3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      42\ \texttt{+}\ \texttt{false}
      \label{ex:sl:s:bad1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \texttt{if}\ (0\ \texttt{<}\ \texttt{false})\ \texttt{then}\ 1\ \texttt{else}\ \texttt{true}
      \label{ex:sl:s:bad2}
\end{equation}

% Forcibly rename the "equation" environment tags to "expression" for the sake
% of the below discussion.
\Crefname{equation}{Expression}{Expressions}

Now, let's evaluate these expressions.
\Cref{ex:sl:s:good1,ex:sl:s:good2,ex:sl:s:good3} can be calculated with a
conventional understanding of the operations, respectively, as \(10\), \(4423\),
and \(95\). However, \Cref{ex:sl:s:bad1,ex:sl:s:bad2} are worrisome. Regarding
\Cref{ex:sl:s:bad1}, we don't have any conventional sense of addition on
integers with booleans, so evaluation is unclear. In \Cref{ex:sl:s:bad2}, we
have two issues: we're trying to relate an integer with a boolean value, and our
if-then-else construction returns differently-typed values depending on the
condition.

\Crefname{equation}{Equation}{Equations}

Other than modifying the syntax into a convoluted mess to avoid issues like
these (which won't be easy, and might not be possible), we look to type systems
to make all expressions of \(\bb{L}\) sound. The key is in understanding that
there are different ``kinds'' (\textit{types}) of values (\textit{terms}), and
forming a system of figuring out which ones are valid (well-typed) or not
(ill-typed). Thus, first, we must analyze and capture our universe of types of
\(\bb{L}\), \(\tau\):

\begin{longtable}{ r c c l}
      \(\Tau(\tau)\) & ::=       & \(\bb{B}\) & Booleans \\
                     & \(\vert\) & \(\bb{Z}\) & Integers
\end{longtable}

Note that we are restricting the numeric-related operations to strictly
integers. The restriction is only there for simplification of numerics. \(\tau\)
is an enumeration of all permissible \textit{types} of \textit{terms} we can
have in \(\bb{L}\).

Next, we need to add the typing rules. They will restrict our syntax to only
those constructions which are semantically valid. We will do so using inference
judgments, as follows\footnote{Note that since there are no variables, there is
no need to have a context \(\Gamma\) on the left-hand side of each typing
judgment.}:

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{n : \bb{Z}}{}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{(where \(n\) is any integer.)}
      \label{eq:exTR:int}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{\texttt{true} : \bb{B}}{}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{True}
      \label{eq:exTR:true}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{\texttt{false} : \bb{B}}{}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{False}
      \label{eq:exTR:false}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{(a\ \texttt{+}\ b) : \bb{Z}}
      {a : \bb{Z}  &  b : \bb{Z}}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{Addition}
      \label{eq:exTR:addition}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{(a\ \texttt{<}\ b) : \bb{B}}
      {a : \bb{Z}  &  b : \bb{Z}}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{``Less than'' comparison}
      \label{eq:exTR:lessThan}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{(a\ \texttt{\wedge}\ b) : \bb{B}}
      {a : \bb{B}  &  b : \bb{B}}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{Conjunction}
      \label{eq:exTR:conjunction}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
      \left.
      \infer{(\texttt{if}\ b\ \texttt{then}\ x\ \texttt{else}\ y) : \tau}
      {b : \bb{B}  &  x : \tau  &  y : \tau}
      \right.
      \qquad
      \text{if-then-else (ternary ``if'')}
      \label{eq:exTR:ifThenElse}
\end{equation}

So as long as we follow these typing rules while we build our expressions, when
we try to evaluate any of these expressions, we should not arrive at invalid
expressions where evaluation cannot be completed. In other words, so as long as
expressions conform to these typing rules, the language is type-safe:
preservation and progress hold. As such, we would like to build a similar system
for \Expr{}\footnote{To begin, we will have \Expr{} typed as that is the main
entry for user-error, but we will eventually also add typing to the other
expression languages in Drasil.}.

Initially, when we sought to implement a type system for \Expr{}, we tried to
piggyback on Haskells type system using type parameters in \Expr{}, \acsp{gadt},
and \acs{ttf}. We were hopeful that we would be able to defer manually checking
our desired type rules to the type signatures of expressions, having \acs{ghc}
provide users with elegant error messages and feedback about typing issues.
While we had success with typing \Expr{}, the implementation didn't fit in well
with the rest of Drasil. Adding it relied on us adding type parameters to
\QuantityDict{}s, having users manually type in the type in the types of
variables in the declarations of quantities. It also required us to use the
``data kinds'' Haskell extension \cite{GHC2020DataKinds} leading to difficulties
with handling and flexibility of types. Additionally, we weren't able to
adequately analyze and work with the types of expressions as needed. Thus, we
decided rolling our own type system would be beneficial, and that we would
manually check expressions as needed.

Now the question arises: how should we build it? One of the issues with the
traditional declaration-style is that expressions made without explicit type
annotations might have ambiguous types should we try to infer one
\cite{nlab:bidirectional_typechecking}. While we don't expect any of these
scenarios to occur with \Expr{}, we might if we also added type-checking to
\ModelExpr{}, where we would like to have higher-order functions and function
abstractions. Thus, we decided to build the type-checker with a modern,
future-proof scheme that will scale against our expected needs
\cite{CaretteDiscussion2022}: with \textit{bidirectional type-checking}.

\subsection{Bidirectional Type Rules}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:type-safe-expressions:subsec:bidirectional-type-rules}

Bidirectional typing rules break the declarative typing judgments into two
typing judgments: a \textit{check} judgment and an \textit{inference} judgment
\cite{Christiansen2013}. The checking judgment, \(\Gamma{} \vdash{} e \Leftarrow
\tau{}\), says that the expression \(e\) can be \textit{checked} to be of the
type \(\tau\) within the context \(\Gamma\). The inference judgment, \(\Gamma{}
\vdash{} e \Rightarrow \tau{}\), says that within the context \(\Gamma\), we can
\textit{infer} the type of expression \(e\), \(\tau\). Checking and inferencing
may be mutually recursive \textemdash{} this is helpful for type checking in
cases where expressions are ambiguous and may take on many shapes (i.e., may be
polymorphic) \cite{nlab:bidirectional_typechecking}.

\section{Typing the Expression Language}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:typing-the-expression-language}

With our goal in mind and our tools in hand, to add type-checking to \Expr{}, we
need to:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
      \item capture the type universe its terms belong to, and
      \item build a system of bidirectional typing rules, and a corresponding
            type-checker.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Type Universe}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:typing-the-expression-language:subsec:type-universe}

Thankfully, there already exists an unused type universe, \Space{}
(\refOriginalSpaceHaskell{}), in Drasil that we can model our type universe
after and potentially start using as intended.

\begin{longtable}{ r c c l}
      \(\texttt{Space}(s)\) & ::=       & \(\bb{Z}\)                                                  & Integers   \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\bb{Q}\)                                                  & Rationals  \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\bb{R}\)                                                  & Reals      \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\bb{N}\)                                                  & Naturals   \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\bb{B}\)                                                  & Booleans   \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\texttt{Ch}\)                                             & Characters \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\texttt{String}\)                                         & Strings    \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\texttt{Vector}(s)\)                                      & Vectors    \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(\texttt{Matrix}(s)\)                                      & Matrices   \\
                            & \(\vert\) & \(s_1 \times s_2 \times \ldots{} \times s_n \rightarrow s\) & Functions  \\
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Type Rules}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:typing-the-expression-language:subsec:type-rules}
\newcommand{\isNum}[1]{\mathit{isNum}(#1)}

We will base our typing rules on the existing \Expr{} language syntax, and focus
on enriching it, not extending it for extra syntax. By applying these typing
rules, we will catch any existing typing issues in the case studies. 

Let \(\isNum{s} = s \in \set{\bb{Z}, \bb{Q}, \bb{R}, \bb{N}}\). The following
inference rules make up our bidirectional type-checker's rules:

Notably, the \hyperlink{tr:check}{``check'' rule} is purely based on type
inference because \Expr{} is a relatively straight-forward language, for which
we can reasonably infer the type of any expression. However, for \ModelExpr{},
this will not be the case. Finally, after having built our type universe and
typing rules, we may implement bidirectional type checking and inferencing for
\Expr{} in Drasil.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{chap:typed-expr:sec:typing-the-expression-language:subsec:implementation}

For a first-pass at adding a type-checker and expression validation in Drasil,
it would be beneficial to be able to check each chunk and expression at once,
displaying all typing issues at once. In other words, it is helpful to perform
type-checking retroactively as opposed to performing interactively, where we
would be forced to create a compiler panic on sight of the first ill-typed
expression. By viewing all typing issues at once, we will be able to rapidly
view what type issues our type-checker implementation causes and revise
accordingly.

Thus, we need to build out the typing context, \(\Gamma\). \(\Gamma\) is the set
of expression terms for which we already know the type of. While \(\Gamma\)
might include whole expressions, the most important information we need while
traversing \Expr{}s is information about the types associated with \UID{}s
(since \Expr{}s, when referring to chunks, only carry \acs{uid} information,
such as for symbols and function applications). Since each \UID{} relates to a
symbol with a unique type, we can build a map that carries everything for us.

\begin{haskell}{Typing Context, \(\Gamma\)}{typingContext}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/f979892d095cceed4d062afb17bd9654bcda4fe2/code/drasil-lang/lib/Language/Drasil/WellTyped.hs\#L17-L19}
-- | We can only type check 'UID's within a type context relating 'UID's to
--   types since they don't carry any type information.
type TypingContext t = M.Map UID t
\end{haskell}

Now we may build our type checker. As we will want to implement type checking
for any expression types (such as for \CodeExpr{} and \ModelExpr{} eventually)
with respect to any type universe (not just \Space{}), we prefer to build the
bidirectional type checker with a typeclass\footnote{Note: we needed to enable
the ``multi-parameter type-classes'' \cite{GHC2020MultiParamTypeClasses}
\acs{ghc} language extension to create and use this type class, at times with
the ``flexible contexts'' \cite{GHC2020FlexibleContexts} extension too.},
instantiated as needed. Using a typeclass with 2 parameters (\(e\) and \(t\))
allows us to build out a bidirectional type checker with respect to any
language, \(e\), and type universe, \(t\).

\begin{haskell}{Modelling Bidirectional Type Checking}{curModellingBidirectionalTypeChecking}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/f979892d095cceed4d062afb17bd9654bcda4fe2/code/drasil-lang/lib/Language/Drasil/WellTyped.hs\#L28-L38}
-- | Build a bidirectional type checker for your expression language, e, with
--   respect to a specific type universe, t.
class (Eq t, Show t) => Typed e t where
  
  -- | Given a typing context and an expression, infer a unique type or explain
  --   what went awry.
  infer :: TypingContext t -> e -> Either t TypeError


  -- | Given a typing context, an expression, and an expected type, check if the
  --   expression can satisfy the expectation.
  check :: TypingContext t -> e -> t -> Either t TypeError
\end{haskell}

At the moment, \inlineHs{TypeError} is merely a type alias for a
\inlineHs{String}, for which we manually typeset in a reasonably okay fashion.
Eventually, it should be replaced with a whole ``breadcrumbs''-like system that
elegantly displays a traversal over an expression, showing where type-checking
may have gone awry and why an expression is ill-typed.

Now we may build out the bidirectional type-checker for \Expr{}:
\refCurrentExprBidirTypeCheckingHaskell{}. After which, all that's left is to
actually use the type-checker.

While we would prefer to localize type-checking to the instant applicable chunks
are created (and expressions too), we unfortunately aren't able to\footnote{At
least not without ease.}. As expressions are formed and symbols are referenced,
the whole symbol type context is missing. At the moment, Drasil gathers all
chunks at once, registers them in memory, and then performs various ``checks''
and generation steps to produce software artifacts. To build the type context,
we would need to build it manually, in a very tedious fashion, for each
expression we build. However, this does not scale well. To localize
type-checking without the extra work, we would need to make our chunk
registration gradual and add a feature for exposing assertions that needs to be
asserted/proven before registration in memory\footnote{We will take steps
towards this in \Cref{chap:storingChunks}, but this task will largely be left
for future work.}. To make a compromise, we will settle for type-checking just
before code and \acs{srs} generation, so that we can notify Drasil-users of any
issues and stop generation. With this information in mind, we need to be able to
extract all expressions and expected types, and relations from our
\InstanceModel{}s and \DataDefinition{}s.

\begin{haskell}{Requiring Type-checking Constraint}{curRequiringTypecheckingConstraint}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/f979892d095cceed4d062afb17bd9654bcda4fe2/code/drasil-lang/lib/Language/Drasil/WellTyped.hs\#L40-L45}
-- | For all containers, c, which contain typed expressions, e, against a
--   specific type universe, t, expose all expressions and relations that need
--   to be type-checked.
class Typed e t => RequiresChecking c e t where
  -- | All things that need type checking.
  requiredChecks :: c -> [(e, t)]
\end{haskell}

With \inlineHs{RequiresChecking}, we have a typeclass for any instance of a
type, \(c\), which may contain any number of expressions of type \(e\) that are
expected to be type-checked with respect to a specific type from a type universe
\(t\). By instantiating this typeclass for \DataDefinition{}s, we expose a
single relation to be type-checked: that a specific \QDefinition{} is
well-formed. Interestingly, by instantiating this typeclass for
\InstanceModel{}s, we potentially expose more than one expression, depending on
the \ModelKind{} variant. Recall from \Cref{chap:modelkinds} that any of our
theories (including \InstanceModel{}s) may take on any of our theory kinds
(\ModelKinds{}), and that some of them may work with and expose expressions
(such as equational realms,
\Cref{chap:more-theory-kinds:sec:classify-all-the-theories:subsec:equational-realms})
in various ways for use. Thus, we allow them to expose the expressions and
relations individually, and we will type-check them similarly. For other
theories, such as the new \acs{ode} model variant, \NewDEModel{}
(\DifferentialModel{}), we may also have a solution system of equations
\cite{Chen2022MEng} that need to be type-checked. Moving on, we may finally plug
in our type-checker!

By using this function before our code generation step, we are able to

typing issues such that we decided it is best to keep type-checking done en
masse, until we've cleared through them. Interestingly, we also found that we
had temporary operations used in places where we needed similar variants which
didn't exist yet. For example, using ``absolute value'' in a place where we
needed vector norm, or using addition/multiplication when we needed vector
addition/scaling. We may enable a compiler panic for our case studies later,
once we've cleared through the majority of the existing found type errors.
Notably, by adding type-checking to Drasil, we also bring into question the
coherence of our \acs{srs} documents. By forcing the \acs{srs} abstraction to
provide sufficiently coherent information to generate code, we also have an
equal assurance that the \acs{srs} is sufficiently \emph{coherent} for
developers to manually build similar software artifacts.

To sum up, at this point, we:

\begin{itemize}

      \item have bidirectional type-checking done for our concrete mathematical
            language with respect to a specific type universe, but creating a
            reusable interface to create similar type-checkers for other
            languages with respect to any type universe,

      \item have type-checking performed after all chunks are gathered and
            registered in memory, and

      \item uncovered many existing typing issues in Drasil's case studies.

\end{itemize}

Once the existing typing issues are resolved, we can enable program panics to
enable a ``hard'' type-checking requirement for all relevant expressions
(including, but not limited to, data definition and instance model theories).
