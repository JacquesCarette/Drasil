Predict-Water-Temperature: Predict the temperature of the water over time.

<div id="pcmTempGS"></div>

Predict-PCM-Temperature: Predict the temperature of the phase change material over time.

<div id="waterEnergyGS"></div>

Predict-Water-Energy: Predict the change in heat energy in the water over time.

<div id="pcmEnergyGS"></div>

Predict-PCM-Energy: Predict the change in heat energy in the PCM over time.
