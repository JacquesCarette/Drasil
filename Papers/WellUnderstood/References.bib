@article{DouviEtAl2021,
	abstract = {In this work, technologies related to the storage of solar energy, utilizing the latent heat content of phase change materials for the production of domestic hot water are reviewed. Many researchers have been involved in this field in order to accomplish the targets of environmentally friendly solutions and higher efficiency. For domestic use, materials with melting temperature between 40 and 80 $\,^{\circ}$C are commonly studied, with paraffins, fatty acids, salt hydrates and alcohols being the most popular. For harvesting the solar radiation, usually flat plate or evacuated tubes solar collectors are used, either commercial ones or modified. The storage unit may include only phase change material or it can have a hybrid form combined with water. The outcome of the most studies, is that the addition of phase change materials in comparison to systems without latent storage, increases the duration of heat release towards the domestic water at the end of the day and also increases the solar collector's efficiency because it does not experience large temperature fluctuations. However, difficulties emerge during the selection of the appropriate storage material as this must have a high melting temperature in order to provide hot enough domestic water, but not higher than the temperature that the solar collector can produce, in order to fully melt the material. Moreover, investigation is necessary for the selection of the optimum water flow rate that minimizes the charging duration and maximizes the system efficiency and hot water amount. Another challenge that researchers face is the low thermal conductivity of many phase change materials. For this purpose, methods for improving the performance of the systems have been examined and they are also reported.},

@book{Dalkir2011,
	abstract = {The ability to manage knowledge has become increasingly important in today's knowledge
economy. Knowledge is considered a valuable commodity, embedded in products and in
the tacit knowledge of highly mobile individual employees. Knowledge management (KM)
represents a deliberate and systematic approach to cultivating and sharing an organization's
knowledge base. It is a highly multidisciplinary field that encompasses both information
technology and intellectual capital. This textbook and professional reference offers
a comprehensive overview of the field of KM, providing both a substantive theoretical
grounding and a pragmatic approach to applying key concepts. Drawing on ideas, tools,
and techniques from such disciplines as sociology, cognitive science, organizational
behavior, and information science, the text describes KM theory and practice at the
individual, community, and organizational levels. It offers illuminating case studies
and vignettes from companies including IBM, Xerox, British Telecommunications, JP
Morgan Chase, and Nokia. This second edition has been updated and revised throughout.
New material has been added on the information and library science perspectives, taxonomies
and knowledge classification, the media richness of the knowledge-sharing channel,
e-learning, social networking in KM contexts, strategy tools, results-based outcome
assessments, knowledge continuity and organizational learning models, KM job descriptions,
copyleft and Creative Commons, and other topics. New case studies and vignettes have
been added; and the references and glossary have been updated and expanded. },

@inproceedings{Farmer2007,
	abstract = {An axiomatic theory represents mathematical knowledge declaratively as a set of axioms. An algorithmic theory represents mathematical knowledge procedurally as a set of algorithms. A biform theory is simultaneously an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory. It represents mathematical knowledge both declaratively and procedurally. Since the algorithms of algorithmic theories manipulate the syntax of expressions, biform theories---as well as algorithmic theories---are difficult to formalize in a traditional logic without the means to reason about syntax. Chiron is a derivative of von-Neumann-Bernays-G{\"o}del (nbg) set theory that is intended to be a practical, general-purpose logic for mechanizing mathematics. It includes elements of type theory, a scheme for handling undefinedness, and a facility for reasoning about the syntax of expressions. It is an exceptionally well-suited logic for formalizing biform theories. This paper defines the notion of a biform theory, gives an overview of Chiron, and illustrates how biform theories can be formalized in Chiron.},

Most build scripts have both too few dependencies (leading to incorrect build outputs) and too many dependencies (leading to excessive rebuilds and reduced parallelism). Any programmer who has wondered why a small change led to excess compilation, or who resorted to a clean step, has suffered the ill effects of incorrect dependency specification. We outline a build system where dependencies are not specified, but instead captured by tracing execution. The consequence is that dependencies are always correct by construction and build scripts are easier to write. The simplest implementation of our approach would lose parallelism, but we are able to recover parallelism using speculation.},

abstract="The design and operation of long-lived, sustainable systems (LSS) are hampered by limited support for change over time and limited preservation of system knowledge. The solution we propose is to adopt software product-line engineering (SPLE) techniques for use in single, critical systems with requirements for sustainability. We describe how four categories of change in a LSS can be usefully handled as variabilities in a software product line. We illustrate our argument with examples of changes from the Voyager spacecraft.",
