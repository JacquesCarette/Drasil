Several of them are important as components of solid-state electronic devices, such as rectifiers, thermoelectric generators, photodetectors, thermistors, and magnets useful in high-frequency circuits. The existence of nonstoichiometric compounds is related to the presence of defects in the lattice structures of crystalline substances, such as the absence},
