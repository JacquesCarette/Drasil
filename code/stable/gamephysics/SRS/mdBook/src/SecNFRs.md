# Non-Functional Requirements {#Sec:NFRs}

This section provides the non-functional requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

<div id="performance"></div>

Performance: The execution time for collision detection and collision resolution shall be comparable to an existing 2D physics library on the market (e.g. Pymunk).

<div id="correctness"></div>

Correctness: The output of simulation results shall be compared to an existing implementation like [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/).

<div id="usability"></div>

Usability: Software shall be easy to learn and use. Usability shall be measured by how long it takes a user to learn how to use the library to create a small program to simulate the movement of 2 bodies over time in space. Creating a program should take no less than 30 to 60 minutes for an intermediate to experienced programmer.

<div id="understandability"></div>

Understandability: Users of Tamias2D shall be able to learn the software with ease. Users shall be able to easily create a small program using the library. Creating a small program to simulate the movement of 2 bodies in space should take no less that 60 minutes.

<div id="maintainability"></div>

Maintainability: If a likely change is made to the finished software, it will take at most 10\\(\\%\\) of the original development time, assuming the same development resources are available.
