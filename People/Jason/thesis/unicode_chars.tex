% At times, if you use raw unicode characters, you'll come across the following error:
% Missing character: There is no • (U+2022) in font ec-lmtt12!

% More, generally,
% Missing character: There is no `X` (U+`Y`) in font `Z`!

% To solve this  issue, we may manually replace instances of them with re-built
% copies of them. They may look a bit out of place because they don't follow the
% same font, but you can make them look decent if you replace them with simpler
% variants within the font. Try your best!

% For example, to resolve the above issue, we may use:
% \newunicodechar{•}{\(\cdot{}\)}

\newunicodechar{•}{\(\cdot{}\)}
\newunicodechar{‘}{\textquoteleft{}}
\newunicodechar{’}{\textquoteright{}}
\newunicodechar{≠}{\(\neq\)}
