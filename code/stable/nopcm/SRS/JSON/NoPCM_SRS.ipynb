    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems provide a novel way of storing energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Solar Water Heating System. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SWHS. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of heat transfer theory from level 3 or 4 mechanical engineering and differential equations from level 1 and 2 calculus. The users of NoPCM can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a> , <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> , <a href=#smithEtAl2007>smithEtAl2007</a> , and <a href=#smithKoothoor2016>smithKoothoor2016</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs). The instance model to be solved is referred to as [IM:eBalanceOnWtr](#IM:eBalanceOnWtr). The instance model provides the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that models the solar water heating system. SWHS solves this ODE.\n",

    "# General System Description\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:GenSysDesc\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides general information about the system. It identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user characteristics, and lists the system constraints.\n",

    "## System Context\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:SysContext\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fig:SysCon](#Figure:SysCon) shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SWHS). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- User Responsibilities:\n",
    " - Provide the input data to the system, ensuring no errors in the data entry\n",
    " - Take care that consistent units are used for input variables\n",
    "- SWHS Responsibilities:\n",
    " - Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a floating point number\n",
    " - Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints\n",

    "\n",
    "To find the rate of change of $T_W$, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water in the tank $V_W$, which has mass $m_W$ and specific heat capacity, $C_W$. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the heating coil as $q_C$ ([GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil](#GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil)), over area $A_C$. No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated ([A:Perfect-Insulation-Tank](#assumpPIT)). Since the assumption is made that no internal heat is generated ([A:No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water](#assumpNIHGBW)), $g = 0$. Therefore, the equation for [GD:rocTempSimp](#GD:rocTempSimp) can be written as:\n",

    "The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsA](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsA) shows the dependencies of assumptions on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsAll) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphRefvsRef](#Figure:TraceGraphRefvsRef) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsR](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsR) shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsAll) shows the dependencies of dependencies of assumptions, models, definitions, requirements, goals, and changes with each other.\n",
