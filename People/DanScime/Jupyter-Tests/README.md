## Notes
- Tables look better with Markdown, do not squish as they have ability to scroll.
- Linking to table, best way seems to put a `<div id="..."></div>` in the first cell of the table.
- Can use math via `$.....$` and display math via `$$.....$$` as in Latex.
- Captions can be done via a new cell and `<div align="center"><b>...</b></div>`
