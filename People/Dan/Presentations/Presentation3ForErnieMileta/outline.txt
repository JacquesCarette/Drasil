Presentation outline: 
  Motivation
    - Same as last time
    - Add graphic of changing reqs to really hammer the point home
  Last time - Simple example, recipes, chunks, KC, design, 
    common/specific knowledge
  Quick recap 
    - Knowledge capture - capture knowledge once and reuse as appropriate
        Why? Because duplication is bad.
    - Generate all the things - All software artifacts (documents/code) should
      be generated from the knowledge-base. No more duplication.
  
  What's new
    - Drasil (name) - Inspiration from Yggdrasil - show picture and mix metaphors
    - Multiple output formats! TeX (old) and HTML (new) - SHOW!
    - No more hacking! (or at least, less)
    - Examples! SO MANY - Toy example still around, but + 4 others
    - Common knowledge database - Thanks to examples
    - Steve! - New PhD student.
      - Integrating GOOL for Code generation 
        (C#,  C++,  Java,  Objective-C,  Python, and Lua.)
      - Working on design doc generation as well
      - Implemented one of the examples
    - Abstraction approach - Picture from Steve meeting 
      - Main point: were working low level, and are now up around instance graph
      - Secondary point: Working our way to most abstract
    - New hierarchy of Chunks
    - New Recipe Language (old ones still around, but incrementally swapping over)
      - SHOW IT
      - Why? EASIER TO WORK WITH! Better understanding!
      
  Next Steps
    - Finish recipe language implementation
    - Clean up examples
    - Work on next level of abstraction
    - Get more examples implemented
    - Generate more artifact types
    - Summer students will help us once again, starting in May.
