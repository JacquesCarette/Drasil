# What if we generated everything?

The "story of Drasil" begins with this simple question:

    What if everything that is current human-written in current software
    development was instead generated?

## Generating everything

What is *everything*? We mean every single artifact that one finds
inside a repository dedicated to a single software project. We mean both
the practical ones currently present in the majority of projects, and
also the idealized ones that our textbooks say should be there but all too
often are not. A non-exhaustive list:

- requirements documentation
- design documentation
- theory manual
- user manual
- CI infrastructure code
- tests
- READMEs
- build infrastructure
- (documented) code

As a means to have a collective word for all of the above, we will
label all of these **softifacts**.

## Generating? Like templates?

Not like templates. Like a program that uses a more semantic source for
all the softifacts, selects the appropriate information for each piece, and
writes each out in its *native format*. The basic idea is that each
softifact contains a quite particular *view* of the total information behind
a single software product, and so the generation process is one of
filtering and translation.

## Like Modelling then?

Much closer to that. Typical MDE approaches are very concerned with a
particular slice out of the softifacts, and assume the rest will be
hand-written.

## Does this even make sense?

(lots of duplication)

## Is it even feasible?

(yes, we have a prototype)

## How does it work?

(a basic idea of the workflow)

- theories, basic ontology
- meta-language of OO languages

## Is this a new idea?

(not really - but previous work didn't really succeed)

## So you have a silver bullet then?

(Heck no! This has some pre-conditions for it to work.)

## Well-understood?

(i.e. where theories of domain, typical design decisions and even
architecture are all well documented in textbooks, and have been
time tested for a long time.)

## And then it's worth it?

Nope. Long-lived is another component.
