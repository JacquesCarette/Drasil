<h1>
Introduction
</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
Due to increasing cost, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, there is a higher demand for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems provide a novel way of storing energy.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the organization of the document, and the characteristics of the intended reader.
</p>
<a id="Sec:DocPurpose">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Purpose of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The main purpose of this document is to describe the modelling of solar water heating system. The goals and theoretical models used in the SWHS code are provided, with an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions and unambiguous definitions. This document is intended to be used as a reference to provide ad hoc access to all information necessary to understand and verify the model. The SRS is abstract because the contents say what problem is being solved, but do not say how to solve it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to &quot;fake&quot; a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:ReqsScope">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Scope of Requirements
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank. Given the appropriate inputs, the code for SWHS is intended to predict the temperature and thermal energy histories for the water.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:ReaderChars">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Characteristics of Intended Reader
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
Reviewers of this documentation should have a strong knowledge in heat transfer theory. A third or fourth year Mechanical Engineering course on this topic is recommended. The reviewers should also have an understanding of differential equations, as typically covered in first and second year Calculus courses. The users of SWHS can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in <a href=#Sec:UserChars>User Characteristics</a>.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:DocOrg">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Organization of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [3] and [6] (<a href=#Sec:References>References</a>). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in <a href=#Sec:IMs>Instance Models</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance model (<a href=#Sec:IMs>Instance Models</a>) to be solved is referred to as IM1. The instance model provides the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that model the solar water heating system. SWHS solves this ODE.

<h3>
Assumptions
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the Theoretical Models [<a href=#Sec:TMs>Theoretical Models</a>], General Definitions [<a href=#Sec:GDs>General Definitions</a>], Data Definitions [<a href=#Sec:DDs>Data Definitions</a>], Instance Models [<a href=#Sec:IMs>Instance Models</a>], or Likely Changes [<a href=#Sec:LCs>Likely Changes</a>], in which the respective assumption is used.
</p>
<a id="A:assump1">
<ul>
A1: The only form of energy that is relevant for this problem is thermal energy. All other forms of energy, such as mechanical energy, are assumed to be negligible [<a href=#T:t1ConsThermE>T:t1ConsThermE</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump2">
<ul>
A2: All heat transfer coefficients are constant over time [GD1].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump3">
<ul>
A3: The water in the tank is fully mixed, so the temperature of the water is the same throughout the entire tank [GD2].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump4">
<ul>
A4: The density of water has no spatial variation; that is, it is constant over their entire volume [GD2, <a href=#LC:likeChg2>likeChg2</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump5">
<ul>
A5: The specific heat capacity of water has no spatial variation; that is, it is constant over its entire volume [GD2].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump7">
<ul>
A6: Newton's law of convective cooling applies between the heating coil and the water [<a href=#DD:ht.flux.C>DD:ht.flux.C</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump8">
<ul>
A7: The temperature of the heating coil is constant over time [<a href=#DD:ht.flux.C>DD:ht.flux.C</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump9">
<ul>
A8: The temperature of the heating coil does not vary along its length [<a href=#DD:ht.flux.C>DD:ht.flux.C</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump9.npnc">
<ul>
A9: The model only accounts for charging of the tank, not discharging. The temperature of the water can only increase, or remain constant; it cannot decrease. This implies that the initial temperature is less than (or equal to) the temperature of the heating coil [IM1, <a href=#LC:likeChg3>likeChg3</a>].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump14">
<ul>
A10: The operating temperature range of the system is such that the water is always in liquid state. That is, the temperature will not drop below the melting point temperature of water, or rise above its boiling point temperature [IM1, IM3].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump15">
<ul>
A11: The tank is perfectly insulated so that there is no heat loss from the tank [IM1].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump12">
<ul>
A12: No internal heat is generated by the water; therefore, the volumetric heat generation per unit volume is zero [IM1].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump13">
<ul>
A13: The pressure in the tank is atmospheric, so the melting point temperature and boiling point temperature are 0&deg;C and 100&deg;C, respectively [IM1, IM2].
</ul>
</a>
<a id="A:assump20">
<ul>
A14: When considering the volume of water in the tank, the volume of the heating coil is assumed to be negligible.

Derivation of the energy balance on water:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
To find the rate of change of <em>T<sub>W</sub></em>, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water <em>V<sub>W</sub></em>, which has mass <em>m<sub>W</sub></em> and specific heat capacity of water, <em>C<sub>W</sub></em>. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the coil as <em>q<sub>C</sub></em>, over area <em>A<sub>C</sub></em>. No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated (<a href=#A:assump15>A11</a>). Assuming no volumetric heat generation per unit volume (<a href=#A:assump12>A12</a>), <em>g = 0</em>. Therefore, the equation for GD2 can be written as:

</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
<a href=#Table:InDataConstraints>Table:InDataConstraints</a>, and <a href=#Table:OutDataConstraints>Table:OutDataConstraints</a> shows the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The column for software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.

Traceability Matrix Showing the Connections Between Assumptions and Other Items
</p>
</a>
<p class="paragraph">
The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. <a href=#Figure:TraceA>Figure:TraceA</a> shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and assumptions on each other. <a href=#Figure:TraceR>Figure:TraceR</a> shows the dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
NOTE: Building a tool to automatically generate the graphical representation of the matrix by scanning the labels and reference can be future work.
