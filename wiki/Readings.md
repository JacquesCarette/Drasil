This section has lists of suggested readings on a variety of topics. Realize that "how long you spend on a paper should be proportional to how useful the paper is." It is often helpful to "start with only a quick survey of a paper", starting by "read[ing] the abstract ... to know if it [the paper] is relevant."

If taking notes on a paper, the main things to record are:
1. "what you think the author's 'take home' message is
2. what you personally learned from the paper
3. the relevance of the paper to your research
4. what questions you have now, from reading the paper, that the paper does not answer"

A good rule of thumb is to limit your summary of a paper's content (including the above items) to "1 page front-and-back".
