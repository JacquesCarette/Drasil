I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Dr.\ Spencer Smith and Dr.\ Jacques Carette. With their guideline, I could break a complex puzzle into smaller pieces and accomplish them one by one. I spent 90\% of my time in remote learning, but the quality of knowledge I received beyond learning in-person. My supervisors quickly adapted the work rhythm during the pandemic, and I greatly benefited from it.

Special thanks to my friend and colleague Jason Balaci for answering my questions and providing excellent suggestions for learning.

I am also thankful to my parents for supporting me in pursuing my second master's degree. Although my parents received very little education, they supported me in pursuing higher education mentally and financially.

Lastly, I want to thank Sophie for motivating me out of the bottom rock of my life.
