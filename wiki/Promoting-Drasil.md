Potential projects for promoting Drasil include the following:

- [white paper on Generating Everything](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/whitePaperOnDrasil/Papers/WP_GenerateEverything/GenerateEverything.tex)
- [teaching example incorporated into Drasil (projectile example)](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/main/CaseStudies/projectile/projectileLesson) including some notes on what goes into a [family of lessons](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/main/CaseStudies/projectile/projectileLesson/AboutProjectileLesson.pdf)
- academic paper example
- [refined theories version of SRS, starting with nopcm example](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/main/CaseStudies/noPCM/docs/SRS/TheoriesVersion_NoPCM_SRS.tex)
- projectile motion example, but with an ODE, rather than closed-from solution
- where to advertise Drasil in lists of open-source software
- Onward paper on Drasil (13 pages)
- Onward essay on productivity (25 pages)
- how would someone use Drasil in the short-term for small projects?  Domain specific projects on JOSS?
- how would we document (in a design artifact) the current design of the generated code for Drasil (input, calculate, output)
- writing up information capture and information encoding
- find the ideas buried in our code base, like the importance of author attribution in scientific software, unitals, ontology
- what softifacts exist and what knowledge is included in those softifacts (something like a reimagining of the work done for [bibliographic references](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13419)
