\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$}

\framesubtitle{A simple example taken from the SRS for FP}

$h_g$ is a symbol which appears in several locations including:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Software Requirements Specification
\item The Literate Programmer's Manual
\item The Source Code
\end{itemize}

Let's take a look!

\midrule
Units & $ML^0t^{-3}T^{-1}$\\
\midrule
SI & $\mathrm{\frac{kW}{m^{2} (^{\circ}C)}}$\\
\midrule
Equation & $h_g$ =$ \frac{2k_{c}h_{p}}{2k_{c}+\tau_c h_{p}}$\\
\midrule
Description & $h_g$ is the  gap conductance\newline
$\tau_c$ is the clad thickness\newline
$h_p$ is initial gap film conductance\newline

\framesubtitle{LPM Definition for $h_g$ (original)}

\begin{equation} 
h_{g} =\frac{2k_{c}h_{p}}{2k_{c}+\tau_c h_{p}}
\end{equation}

The corresponding C code is given by:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny]
double calc_hg(double k_c,double h_b,double tau_c)
{
 return (2*(k_c)*(h_p)) / ((2*(k_c)) + (tau_c*(h_p)));

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$}

\framesubtitle{A simple example taken from the SRS for FP}

Modifying $h_g$ to reflect changes in requirements is not a simple
matter. It involves, at the very least, the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Update the definition in the SRS, LPM, and all other documents which
  reference the symbol
\item Modify the source code to reflect the new requirements
\item Trace all dependencies
\item Modify dependents to accomodate the change
\item Ensure each of the documents is now up to date and consistent
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$}

\framesubtitle{Simplifying the process}

%This is where knowledge capture comes into play. 
Here is an example of a ``chunk'' for $h_g$:

\pgfuseimage{ex1}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$}

\framesubtitle{How do we generate?}
What do we do with the ``chunk''?

That depends on the ``recipe''!

\begin{itemize}
\item To create our SRS we use the following recipe:
\end{itemize}

\pgfuseimage{rec1}

\begin{itemize}
\item To create our LPM we use the following recipe:
