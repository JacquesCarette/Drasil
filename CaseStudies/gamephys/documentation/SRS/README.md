Revision Notes
--------------

**07/06/2016**
- Tidied up the formatting of models and definitions to make it more readable and similar to other SRSs.
- Changed goal statements and the corresponding instance models quite a bit.
- Added new collision equations from Hecker's papers.
- Changed symbols used in table of symbols - removed most (if not all) unused symbols, added new ones (e.g. theta for - angular displacement, new collision-related symbols, damping coeff to ratio).
- Updated internal references to tables and models.
- Added assumptions, likely changes, GD for gravity, DD for center of mass, derivations for collision impulse and collision diagram.

To-do
-----

- Hecker papers need to be added to references.
