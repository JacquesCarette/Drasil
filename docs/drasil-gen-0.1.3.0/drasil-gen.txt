-- | Defines Drasil generator functions.
module Language.Drasil.Generate
dumpTo :: ToJSON a => a -> TargetFile -> IO ()
dumpEverything :: SystemInformation -> Path -> IO ()
typeCheckSI :: SystemInformation -> IO ()

-- | Generate a number of artifacts based on a list of recipes.
gen :: DocSpec -> Document -> PrintingInformation -> IO ()

-- | Generates traceability graphs as .dot files.
genDot :: SystemInformation -> IO ()

-- | Calls the code generator.
genCode :: Choices -> CodeSpec -> IO ()

-- | Generates debugging logs to show all of the <a>UID</a>s used in an
--   example.
genLog :: SystemInformation -> PrintingInformation -> IO ()

-- | Document types include Software Requirements Specification and
--   Website. Choosing SRS will generate both TeX and HTML files, while
--   Website generates only as HTML. This also determines what folders the
--   generated files will be placed into.
data DocType
SRS :: DocType
Website :: DocType
Jupyter :: DocType

-- | Document specifications. Holds the type of document (<a>DocType</a>)
--   and its name (<a>Filename</a>).
data DocSpec
DocSpec :: DocChoices -> Filename -> DocSpec

-- | Possible formats for printer output.
data Format
TeX :: Format
HTML :: Format
JSON :: Format

-- | Document choices include the type of document as well as the file
--   formats we want to generate as.
data DocChoices
DC :: DocType -> [Format] -> DocChoices

-- | Constructor for users to choose their document options
docChoices :: DocType -> [Format] -> DocChoices
