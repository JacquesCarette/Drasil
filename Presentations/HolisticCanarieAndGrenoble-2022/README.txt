The files are the original (long) version Smith wrote (CanarieAbstract), the 250 word
a revised version from JC (CanarieAbstract-JC) and an approximation of the
submitted version (CanarieAbstract-Submitted).  Unfortunately the call for
proposals and the actual submission webpage had very different rules (250 words
versus 800 characters).
