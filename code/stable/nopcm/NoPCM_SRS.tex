\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Intr}
Due to increasing cost, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, there is a higher demand for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems provide a novel way of storing energy.
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the organization of the document, and the characteristics of the intended reader.
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{Sec:PurpofDocu}
The main purpose of this document is to describe the modelling of solar water heating system. The goals and theoretical models used in the SWHS code are provided, with an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions and unambiguous definitions. This document is intended to be used as a reference to provide ad hoc access to all information necessary to understand and verify the model. The SRS is abstract because the contents say what problem is being solved, but do not say how to solve it.
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to ``fake" a rational design process.
\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
\label{Sec:ScopofRequ}
The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank. Given the appropriate inputs, the code for Solar Water Heating Systems is intended to predict the temperature and thermal energy histories for the water.
\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:CharofInteRead}
Reviewers of this documentation should have a strong knowledge in heat transfer theory. A third or fourth year Mechanical Engineering course on this topic is recommended. The reviewers should also have an understanding of differential equations, as typically covered in first and second year Calculus courses. The users of Solar Water Heating Systems can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in Section~\ref{Sec:UserChar}.
\subsection{Organization of Document}
\label{Sec:OrgaofDocu}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by {[}3{]} and {[}6{]} (Section~\ref{Sec:Refe}). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in Section~\ref{Sec:InstMode} and trace back to find any additional information they require.
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance model (Section~\ref{Sec:InstMode}) to be solved is referred to as IM1. The instance model provides the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that model the solar water heating system. SWHS solves this ODE.
\section{General System Description}
\label{Sec:GeneSystDesc}
This section provides general information about the system, identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, and describes the user characteristics and the system constraints.
\subsection{System Context}
\label{Sec:SystCont}
Figure~\ref{Figure::SystCont} shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SWHS). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure.png}
\caption{Figure~\ref{Figure::SystCont}: System Context}
\label{Figure::SystCont}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
SWHS is mostly self-contained. The only external interaction is through the user interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{User Responsibilities:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Provide the input data to the system, ensuring no errors in the data entry}
\item{Take care that consistent units are used for input variables}
\end{enumerate}
\item{SWHS Responsibilities:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a floating point number}
\item{Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints}
\item{Calculate the required outputs}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{Sec:UserChar}
The end user of SWHS should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1 Calculus and Physics.
\subsection{System Constraints}
\label{Sec:SystCons}
There are no system constraints.
\section{Specific System Description}
\label{Sec:SpecSystDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally the instance model (ODE) that models the solar water heating tank.

For this equation to apply, other forms of energy, such as mechanical energy, are assumed to be negligible in the system (A\ref{A:assump1}).

Description & The basic equation governing the rate of change of temperature, for a given volume $V$, with time. $m$ is the mass (kg). $C$ is the specific heat capacity ($\frac{\text{J}}{(\text{kg}{}^{\circ}\text{C})}$). $T$ is the temperature (${}^{\circ}$C) and $t$ is the time (s). ${q_{in}}$ and ${q_{out}}$ are the in and out heat transfer rates, respectively ($\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^{2}}$). ${A_{in}}$ and ${A_{out}}$ are the surface areas over which the heat is being transferred in and out, respectively ($\text{m}^{2}$). $g$ is the volumetric heat generated ($\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^{3}}$). $V$ is the volume ($\text{m}^{3}$).
\\ \bottomrule \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}\\
Detailed derivation of simplified rate of change of temperature:
Integrating \hyperref[T:t1ConsThermE]{Definition~T:t1ConsThermE} over a volume ($V$), we have:
\begin{dmath}
\left(-\int_{V}{\nabla{}\cdot{}\mathbf{q}dV}\right)+\int_{V}{gdV}=\int_{V}{\rho{} C \frac{\partial{} T}{\partial{} t}dV}
\end{dmath}
Applying Gauss's Divergence Theorem to the first term over the surface $S$ of the volume, with $\mathbf{q}$ as the thermal flux vector for the surface and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ as a unit outward normal vector for a surface:
\begin{dmath}
\left(-\int_{S}{\mathbf{q}\cdot{}\mathbf{\hat{n}}dS}\right)+\int_{V}{gdV}=\int_{V}{\rho{} C \frac{\partial{} T}{\partial{} t}dV}
\end{dmath}
We consider an arbitrary volume. The volumetric heat generation per unit volume is assumed constant. Then (1) can be written as:
\begin{dmath}
{q_{in}} {A_{in}}-{q_{out}} {A_{out}}+g V=\int_{V}{\rho{} C \frac{\partial{} T}{\partial{} t}dV}
\end{dmath}
Where ${q_{in}}$, ${q_{out}}$, ${A_{in}}$, and ${A_{out}}$ are explained in GD2. Assuming $\rho{}$, $C$ and $T$ are constant over the volume, which is true in our case by Assumptions (A\ref{A:assump3}), (A\ref{A:assump4}), and (A\ref{A:assump5}), we have:
\begin{dmath}
\rho{} C V \frac{d T}{d t}={q_{in}} {A_{in}}-{q_{out}} {A_{out}}+g V
\end{dmath}
Using the fact that $\rho{}$=$m$/$V$, (2) can be written as:
\begin{dmath}
m C \frac{d T}{d t}={q_{in}} {A_{in}}-{q_{out}} {A_{out}}+g V
\end{dmath}

Equation & $\frac{d {T_{W}}}{d t}=\frac{1}{{\tau{}_{W}}} \left({T_{C}}-{T_{W}}\left(t\right)\right)$
\\ \midrule \\
Description & ${T_{W}}$ is the temperature of the water (${}^{\circ}$C). ${T_{C}}$ is the temperature of the heating coil (${}^{\circ}$C). ${\tau{}_{W}}=\frac{{m_{W}} {C_{W}}}{{h_{C}} {A_{C}}}$ is a constant (s). The above equation applies as long as the water is in liquid form, $0<{T_{W}}<100$ (${}^{\circ}$C) where 0 (${}^{\circ}$C) and 100 (${}^{\circ}$C) are the melting and boiling point temperatures of water, respectively (A\ref{A:assump10}).
\\ \bottomrule \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}\\
Derivation of the energy balance on water:
To find the rate of change of ${T_{W}}$, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water ${V_{W}}$, which has mass ${m_{W}}$ and specific heat capacity of water, ${C_{W}}$. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the coil as ${q_{C}}$, over area ${A_{C}}$. No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated (A\ref{A:assump15}). Assuming no volumetric heat generation per unit volume (A\ref{A:assump12}), $g=0$. Therefore, the equation for GD2 can be written as:
\begin{dmath}
{m_{W}} {C_{W}} \frac{d {T_{W}}}{d t}={q_{C}} {A_{C}}
\end{dmath}
Using \hyperref[DD:ht.flux.C]{Definition~DD:ht.flux.C}, this can be written as:
\begin{dmath}
{m_{W}} {C_{W}} \frac{d {T_{W}}}{d t}={h_{C}} {A_{C}} \left({T_{C}}-{T_{W}}\right)
\end{dmath}
Dividing (3) by ${m_{W}}$${C_{W}}$, we obtain:
\begin{dmath}
\frac{d {T_{W}}}{d t}=\frac{{h_{C}} {A_{C}}}{{m_{W}} {C_{W}}} \left({T_{C}}-{T_{W}}\right)
\end{dmath}
Setting ${\tau{}_{W}}$=${m_{W}}$${C_{W}}$/${h_{C}}$${A_{C}}$, Equation (4) can be written in its final form as:
\begin{dmath}
\frac{d {T_{W}}}{d t}=\frac{1}{{\tau{}_{W}}} \left({T_{C}}-{T_{W}}\right)
\end{dmath}

\\ \midrule \\
Equation & ${E_{W}}\left(t\right)={C_{W}} {m_{W}} \left({T_{W}}\left(t\right)-{T_{init}}\right)$
\\ \midrule \\
Description & The above equation is derived using T2. ${E_{W}}$ is the change in thermal energy of the liquid water relative to the energy at the initial temperature (${T_{init}}$) (J). ${C_{W}}$ is the specific heat capacity of liquid water ($\frac{\text{J}}{(\text{kg}{}^{\circ}\text{C})}$) and ${m_{W}}$ is the mass of the water (kg). The change in temperature is the difference between the temperature at time $t$ (s), ${T_{W}}$ and the initial temperature, ${T_{init}}$ (${}^{\circ}$C). This equation applies as long as $0<{T_{W}}<0$${}^{\circ}$C (A\ref{A:assump14}, A\ref{A:assump19}).

\subsubsection{Data Constraints}
\label{Sec:DataCons}
Table~\ref{Table:InpuDataCons}, and Table~\ref{Table:OutpDataCons} shows the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The column for software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise.

\section{Requirements}
\label{Sec:Requ}
This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the software is expected to complete, and the non-functional requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{Sec:FuncRequ}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req1}:]Input the following quantities, which define the tank parameters, material properties and initial conditions:
\end{description}
\begin{longtabu}{l l X[l]}
\toprule
Symbol & Unit & Description
\\
\midrule
$L$ & m & length of tank
\\
$D$ & m & diameter of tank
\\
${A_{C}}$ & $\text{m}^{2}$ & heating coil surface area
\\
${T_{C}}$ & ${}^{\circ}$C & temperature of the heating coil
\\
${\rho{}_{W}}$ & $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^{3}}$ & density of water
\\
${C_{W}}$ & $\frac{\text{J}}{(\text{kg}{}^{\circ}\text{C})}$ & specific heat capacity of water
\\
${h_{C}}$ & $\frac{\text{W}}{(\text{m}^{2}{}^{\circ}\text{C})}$ & convective heat transfer coefficient between coil and water
\\
${T_{init}}$ & ${}^{\circ}$C & initial temperature
\\
${t_{final}}$ & s & final time
\\
\bottomrule
\label{Table:InpuVariRequ}
\end{longtabu}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req2}:]Use the inputs in R\ref{R:req1} to find the mass needed for IM1 to IM2, as follows, where ${V_{W}}$ is the volume of water and ${V_{tank}}$ is the volume of the cylindrical tank:
\end{description}
\begin{dmath}
{m_{W}}={V_{W}} {\rho{}_{W}}=\frac{D}{2} L {\rho{}_{W}}
\end{dmath}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req3}:]Verify that the inputs satisfy the required physical constraint shown in Table~\ref{Table:InpuDataCons}.
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req4}:]Outputs and inputs quantities and derived quantities in the following list: the quantities from R\ref{R:req1}, the mass from R\ref{R:req2} and ${\tau{}_{W}}$ (from IM1).
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req5}:]Calculate and output the temperature of the water (${T_{W}}$($t$)) over the simulation time
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{reqnum}\rthereqnum\label{R:req6}:]Calculate and output the change in heat energy in the water (${E_{W}}$($t$)) over the simulation time (from IM3).
\end{description}
\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{Sec:Non-Requ}
This problem is small in size and relatively simple, so performance is not a priority. Any reasonable implementation will be very quick and use minimal storage. Rather than performance, the non-functional requirement priorities are correctness, verifiability, understandability, reusability, and maintainability.
\section{Likely Changes}
\label{Sec:LikeChan}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lcthelcnum\label{LC:likeChg2}:]A\ref{A:assump8} - The temperature of the heating coil will change over the course of the day, depending on the energy received from the sun.
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lcthelcnum\label{LC:likeChg3}:]A\ref{A:assump9} - The temperature of the heating coil will actually change along its length as the water within it cools.
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lcthelcnum\label{LC:likeChg3}:]A\ref{A:assump9npnc}- The model currently only accounts for charging of the tank. A more complete model would also account for discharging of the tank.
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{lcnum}\lcthelcnum\label{LC:likeChg6}:]A\ref{A:assump15} - Any real tank cannot be perfectly insulated and will lose heat.
\end{description}
\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}
\label{Sec:TracMatrandGrap}
The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an ``X" should be modified as well. Table~\ref{Table:TracMatrShowtheConnBetwRequandInstMode} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:TracMatrShowtheConnBetwRequandInstMode} shows the dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other. Table~\ref{Table:TracMatrShowtheConnBetwAssuandOtheItem} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on the assumptions.

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. Figure~\ref{Figure:TracGrapShowtheConnBetwItemofDiffSect} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Figure:TracGrapShowtheConnBetwRequInstModeandDataCons} shows the dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
NOTE: Building a tool to automatically generate the graphical representation of the matrix by scanning the labels and reference can be future work.
