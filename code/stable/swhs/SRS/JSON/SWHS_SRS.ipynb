    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems incorporating phase change material (PCM) use a renewable energy source and provide a novel way of storing energy. Solar water heating systems incorporating PCM improve over the traditional solar water heating systems because of their smaller size. The smaller size is possible because of the ability of PCM to store thermal energy as latent heat, which allows higher thermal energy storage capacity per unit weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Solar Water Heating System. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SWHS. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank incorporating PCM. This entire document is written assuming that the substances inside the solar water heating tank are water and PCM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of heat transfer theory from level 3 or 4 mechanical engineering and differential equations from level 1 and 2 calculus. The users of SWHS can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a>  and <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs). The instance models to be solved are referred to as [IM:eBalanceOnWtr](#IM:eBalanceOnWtr), [IM:eBalanceOnPCM](#IM:eBalanceOnPCM), [IM:heatEInWtr](#IM:heatEInWtr), and [IM:heatEInPCM](#IM:heatEInPCM). The instance models provide the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and algebraic equations that model the solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. SWHS solves these ODEs.\n",

    "To find the rate of change of $T_W$, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water in the tank $V_W$, which has mass $m_W$ and specific heat capacity, $C_W$. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the heating coil as $q_C$ ([GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil](#GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil)) and from the water into the PCM as $q_P$ ([GD:htFluxPCMFromWater](#GD:htFluxPCMFromWater)), over areas $A_C$ and $A_P$, respectively. The thermal flux is constant over $A_C$, since the temperature of the heating coil is assumed to not vary along its length ([A:Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length](#assumpTHCCoL)), and the thermal flux is constant over $A_P$, since the temperature of the PCM is the same throughout its volume ([A:Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume](#assumpTPCAV)) and the water is fully mixed ([A:Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank](#assumpCWTAT)). No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated ([A:Perfect-Insulation-Tank](#assumpPIT)). Since the assumption is made that no internal heat is generated ([A:No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water-PCM](#assumpNIHGBWP)), $g = 0$.

    "To find the rate of change of $T_P$, we look at the energy balance on the PCM. The volume being considered is the volume of PCM ($V_P$). The derivation that follows is initially for the solid PCM. The mass of phase change material is $m_P$ and the specific heat capacity of PCM as a solid is $C_P^S$. The heat flux into the PCM from water is $q_P$ ([GD:htFluxPCMFromWater](#GD:htFluxPCMFromWater)) over phase change material surface area $A_P$. The thermal flux is constant over $A_P$, since the temperature of the PCM is the same throughout its volume ([A:Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume](#assumpTPCAV)) and the water is fully mixed ([A:Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank](#assumpCWTAT)). There is no heat flux output from the PCM. Assuming no volumetric heat generation per unit volume ([A:No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water-PCM](#assumpNIHGBWP)), $g = 0$, the equation for [GD:rocTempSimp](#GD:rocTempSimp) can be written as:\n",

    "The [Data Constraints Table](#Table:InDataConstraints) shows the data constraints on the input variables. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The column for software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values. (*) These quantities cannot be equal to zero, or there will be a divide by zero in the model. (+) These quantities cannot be zero, or there would be freezing ([A:PCM-Initially-Solid](#assumpPIS)). (++) The constraints on the surface area are calculated by considering the surface area to volume ratio. The assumption is that the lowest ratio is 1 and the highest possible is $\\frac{2}{h_min}$, where $h_min$ is the thickness of a \"sheet\" of PCM. A thin sheet has the greatest surface area to volume ratio. (**) The constraint on the maximum time at the end of the simulation is the total number of seconds in one day.\n",
