# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

A pendulum consists of mass attached to the end of a rod and its moving curve is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Therefore, it is useful to have a program to simulate the motion of the pendulum to exhibit its chaotic characteristics. The program documented here is called Double Pendulum.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Double Pendulum. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
