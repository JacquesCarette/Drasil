The Input Verification Module verify_valid program outputs an integer variable 
called err in this implementation. The module itself does not raise any 
exceptions. Instead, the Control Module checks the err variable and calls 
EXIT_FAILURE if the integer is greater than 0. This is done because C does not 
support error handling.

The Input Verification Module verify_recommended program outputs an integer 
variable called warnings in this implementation. This is for testing purposes 
since the warnings are not otherwise detectable by the testing framework.

The Temperature ODEs Module access programs do not actually output anything in 
this implementation. However, they define the functions required by the ODE 
Solver Module, which has the same effect as outputting the functions in this 
case. 

The Temperature ODEs Module access programs take different input in this 
implementation than what is shown in the MIS, as required by the ODE Solver 
Module. 
- The Tw, Tp, and Qp variables are both contained in the yPhase argument. 
- The params argument does not exist in this implementation because the ODE 
  Solver Module does not allow for it. Instead, params is defined outside of 
  the main function so that it is available to the other functions in the 
  main.c file. 
- There are two additional arguments, yPhasedot and user_data, which are 
  required by the ODE Solver.

The abstract functions described in the MIS are realized by the temperature1, 
temperature2, temperature3, event1, and event2 functions. The actual 
variable names in this implementation for each function appear in parentheses 
in the following description. Each function takes the real values of time (t), 
water temperature (y1), PCM temperature (y2), and latent Heat (y3) 
(temperature2 and event2 only) and generates a real value
output (yd1, yd2, yd3, or gout).

The ODE Solver Module access program "solve" described in the MIS is a 
combination of the following calls in this implementation:
- cvode_mem = CVodeCreate(CV_BDF, CV_NEWTON);
- CVodeInit(cvode_mem, temperature1, tinit, yPhase1);
- CVodeSVtolerances(cvode_mem, reltol, abstol1);
- CVodeRootInit(cvode_mem, 1, event1);
- CVDense(cvode_mem, N1);
- CVDlsSetDenseJacFn(cvode_mem, Jac1);
- flag = CVode(cvode_mem, tout, yPhase1, &t, CV_NORMAL);

Note: These are for the ODE solver for the first phase of the simulation. If 
the second or third phase occurs, they are called by the same commands with the 
appropriate changes to the arguments.

Note: The last call in the list occurs in a loop through the simulation time 
range.

The ODE Solver Module in this implementation does not accept an array of reals 
representing the time domain for the simulation as an argument. Instead it 
takes a single real representing the initial time (tinit), and the end time is 
determined by the loop from which the ODE solver is called.

The ODE Solver Module accepts some extra arguments not specified in the MIS. 
yPhase1 holds the water temperature and PCM temperature. For the melting phase 
of the simulation, a similar argument would hold latent heat in addition to 
these other results. CV_BDF, CV_NEWTON, and CV_NORMAL describe methods for the 
ODE solver to use. Jac1 refers to a function defining the Jacobian matrix for 
the system of ODEs, which is required by this ODE solver. N1 represents the 
number of ODEs in the system. cvode_mem represents the memory allocated for the 
ODE solver.

The ODE Solver Module in this implementation has the following possible 
exceptions not specified in the MIS. Their descriptions are taken directly from 
the user guide for CVODE:
- CV_ERR_FAILURE: Error test failures occurred too many times during one 
  internal time step or minimum step size was reached.
- CV_CONV_FAILURE: Convergence test failures occurred too many times during one 
  internal time step or minimum step size was reached.
- CV_LINIT_FAIL: The linear solver's initialization function failed.
- CV_LSETUP_FAIL: The linear solver's setup function failed in an unrecoverable 
  manner.
- CV_LSOLVE_FAIL: The linear solver's solve function failed in an unrecoverable 
  manner.
- CV_RHSFUNC_FAIL: The right-hand side function failed in an unrecoverable 
  manner.
- CV_FIRST_RHSFUNC_ERR: The right-hand side function failed at the first call.
- CV_REPTD_RHSFUNC_ERR: The right-hand side function had repeated recoverable 
  errors.
- CV_UNREC_RHSFUNC_ERR: The right-hand side function had a recoverable error, 
  but no recovery is possible.
- CV_RTFUNC_FAIL: The rootfinding function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
- CV_MEM_FAIL: A memory allocation failed.
- CV_MEM_NULL: The cvode_mem argument was NULL.
- CV_NO_MALLOC: The CVODE memory block was not allocated by a call to 
  CVodeMalloc.
- CV_BAD_K: The derivative order k is larger than the order used.
- CV_BAD_T: The time t is outside the last step taken.
- CV_BAD_DKY: The output derivative vector is NULL.
- CV_TOO_CLOSE: The output and initial times are too close to each other.


The Energy Module access programs do not output an array of reals in this 
implementation. Instead, they output a single real and are called in a loop 
through each time point from the Control Module to generate the entire array.

The Output Verification Module and Output Format Module take an extra argument 
in this implementation. The argument is an integer variable representing the 
size of the result lists, to be used for memory allocation purposes within 
these modules.

The Plotting Module does not receive any inputs except for filename in this 
implementation. This is because gnuplot reads the results from the output file 
rather than the variables.

The Output Format Module does not use the max_width constant in this 
implementation.
