# Physical System Description {#Sec:PhysSyst}

The physical system of DblPend, as shown in [Fig:dblpend](./SecPhysSyst.md#Figure:dblpend), includes the following elements:

PS1: The first rod (with length of the first rod \\({L\_{1}}\\)).

PS2: The second rod (with length of the second rod \\({L\_{2}}\\)).

PS3: The first object.

PS4: The second object.

PS5: Each object's motion is described using vectors in 2D space Cl(2,0).

PS6: Physical quantities (velocity, acceleration, force) are unified as geometric entities with basis vectors e₁ and e₂.
