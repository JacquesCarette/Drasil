# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

Heat transfer through the cladding of a nuclear fuel element influences performance and safety. Engineers therefore rely on dependable calculations of the heat transfer coefficients used for simulating the temperature. This document describes the requirements of a program called HGHC.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for HGHC. This section explains the purpose of this document.
