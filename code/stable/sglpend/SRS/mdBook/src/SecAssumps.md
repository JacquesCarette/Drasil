# Assumptions {#Sec:Assumps}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical models by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The assumptions refine the scope by providing more detail.

<div id="twoDMotion"></div>

twoDMotion: The pendulum motion is two-dimensional (2D).

<div id="cartSys"></div>

cartSys: A Cartesian coordinate system is used.

<div id="cartSysR"></div>

cartSysR: The Cartesian coordinate system is right-handed where positive \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis point right up.

<div id="yAxisDir"></div>

yAxisDir: The direction of the \\(y\\)-axis is directed opposite to gravity.

<div id="startOrigin1x"></div>

startOrigin: The pendulum is attached to the origin.
