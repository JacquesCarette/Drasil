Drasil is a framework that generates software, including code, documentation, software requirement specification, user manual, and axillary files. Recently, the Drasil team has been interested in expanding its knowledge to solve higher-order ODEs. In this research, for single higher-order linear ODEs, the Drasil framework can solve them without manually extracted information. For higher-order nonlinear ODEs, the Drasil framework can solve them with manually extracted information.

Firstly, we design a flexible and reusable structure to store ODE information based on conventional mathematical knowledge. This makes it possible to reuse ODE information for documentation and for code generation. Secondly, we provide a commonality analysis of four external ODE solver libraries. The analysis includes how they solve the ODE, what algorithms they use, and what options they provide for different types of output. Thirdly, we enable the Drasil Code Generator to solve nonlinear higher-order ODEs with some manually extracted information. We created a new case study, Double Pendulum, that has a system of higher-order ODE. Further, we solve the Double Pendulum example numerically via external libraries. Lastly, for single higher-order ODEs, the Drasil Code Generator can generate code without manually extracted information.

This research accomplishes three main goals. Firstly, we capture the knowledge of linear ODE in a flexible and reusable structure. Secondly, we expand the Drasil capability to solve higher-order ODEs with/without manually written equations. Solving single higher-order linear ODEs does not require manually extracted information. To solve nonlinear ODEs, manually extracting information from the original ODE is still required. The last one is removing the duplicated information caused by the implementation of solving ODEs.
