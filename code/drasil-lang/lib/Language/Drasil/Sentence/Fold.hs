-- | Partial function application of 'foldle' for sentences specifically.
-- Folds with spaces and adds a period (".") at the end.

foldlSent = foldle (+:+) (+:+.) EmptyS

-- | 'foldlSent' but does not add a period.
foldlSent_ :: [Sentence] -> Sentence

-- | 'foldlSent' but ends with colon.

-- | Type to help wrap a sentence with parenthesis or to add a period at the end.

-- | Type to help separate words with commas or semicolons.

-- | Type to help fold differently between listed items, or if there are options (ex. using "and" or "or" at the end of a list of words).
