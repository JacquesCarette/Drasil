dumpTo :: ToJSON a => a -> TargetFile -> IO ()

-- | For debugging purposes, if the system has a <tt>DEBUG_ENV</tt>
--   environment variable set to anything, we can dump the chunk maps in a
--   system to the host system.

gen :: DocSpec -> Document -> PrintingInformation -> IO ()

-- | Generates traceability graphs as .dot files.

-- | Calls the code generator.
genCode :: Choices -> CodeSpec -> IO ()

-- | Document types include Software Requirements Specification and
--   Website. Choosing SRS will generate both TeX and HTML files, while
--   Website generates only as HTML. This also determines what folders the
--   generated files will be placed into.
