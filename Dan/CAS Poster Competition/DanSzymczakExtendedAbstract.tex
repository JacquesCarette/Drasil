\section{Research Problem}

Software artifacts contain a vast amount of knowledge duplication and
transformation. A single piece of underlying knowledge should appear (in some
form) in every artifact for a given piece of software.

In certain domains,
like Scientific Computing (SC),
knowledge is duplicated across many different pieces of software. This
duplication is almost exclusively performed manually, whether by copying/pasting
from existing artifacts, or by transcription from another source such as a textbook.

Artifacts tend to fall out of sync over their lifecycle,
negatively impacting overall software quality. This is most noticeable 
when it comes to maintainability, traceability, and particularly verifiability.

\section{Approach}

We are using ideas from Literate Programming (LP) and Generative Programming
(GP) to capture knowledge, reduce manual duplication, and generate software
artifacts. We have created a framework, Drasil, to accomplish this through a
practical, example-driven approach involving frequent redesigns and refactoring.

In Drasil, knowledge is captured in \textit{chunks}, which are then used in
conjunction with our \textit{recipes} to generate software artifacts (requirements
specifications, design documents, source code, etc.) in various formats.

Recipes are built from a number of custom Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
embedded in Haskell. The recipes allow us to target our output to specific
audiences, creating different ``views'' of our knowledge-base with minimal
effort. These views can be large-scale (ex. different artifact types) or
small-scale (ex. showing/hiding verbose descriptions within an artifact). We are
currently implementing a new recipe DSL to gain a higher level of abstraction,
which will be easier to work with than the previous implementation.

%Chunks + Chunk Hierarchy

%    - DSLs all the way down.

\section{Preliminary results}
As of this writing, there are currently six example projects being redeveloped
using Drasil. Advantages of the approach have already become clear.

Knowledge capture has lead to reduced knowledge duplication. Common knowledge
across different examples is captured once and reused as necessary. For example,
conservation of thermal energy appears in multiple examples.

Traceability is guaranteed as everything is generated from the knowledge-base.
The recipe is aware of all necessary chunks and can easily produce a trace to
a given knowledge source.

Software becomes more maintainable when using Drasil as there is a single unique
source for knowledge. Any mistakes in the knowledge-base will appear everywhere
in the generated artifacts, making them easy to find and easier to fix. Only one
source must be updated to propagate a fix through all artifacts.

There is one main disadvantage to a knowledge-based approach -- the large up-front
investment in creating and expanding the knowledge base. However, we believe this
investment is worthwhile for the long-term gains.
