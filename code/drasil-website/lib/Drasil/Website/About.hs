  \from a stable knowledge base, focusing currently on scientific software. The main goals are to reduce knowledge \
  \duplication and improve traceability. The artifacts are generated from a common knowledge-base using recipes \
  \written in a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). These recipes allow us to specify which pieces of \
  \knowledge should be used in which artifacts, how to transform them, and more. For more information on the design, documentation, \

aboutParagraph5 :: Reference -> Sentence

  \Drasil uses specific terminology to address types of \
  \knowledge for the purpose of encoding information, since we know that we want to eventually generate words, sentences, paragraphs, \
  \whole documents with headings, references, formulas, tables, graphs, and code. This is done by trying to understand the basic 'units' \
  \of all artifacts, and methods for composing larger structures from these units. The removal of duplicate units is an important feature \
  \of this methodology. The basic building blocks of the methodology include different expressions for units with a specific meaning. \
  \These are built into ontologies of domains that address broader knowledge. Chunks form a fundamental part of such ontologies."

  \in holding a specific type of information for \
  \a specific purpose so that knowledge may be used in generated models, definitions, and theories. Chunks are usually made up of several \
  \lower-level types that hold lower-lever information; when contained together, these pieces of lower-level information hold a new specific \
  \purpose. The structure of a chunk can be thought of as a wrapper of information, and this is all implemented using Haskell's record-type \
  \syntax. Recipes transform the acquired knowledge into a usable format."
