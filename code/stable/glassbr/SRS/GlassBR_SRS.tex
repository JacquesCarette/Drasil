\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Intro}
Software is helpful to efficiently and correctly predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab. The blast under consideration is any kind of man-made explosion. The software, herein called GlassBR, aims to predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab using an intuitive interface.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for GlassBR. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{Sec:DocPurpose}
The main purpose of this document is to predict whether a given glass slab is likely to resist a specified blast. The goals and theoretical models used in the GlassBR code are provided, with an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions and unambiguous definitions. This document is intended to be used as a reference to provide all information necessary to understand and verify the analysis. The SRS is abstract because the contents say what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.

This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out \cite{parnasClements1986}, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to ``fake'' a rational design process.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
\label{Sec:ReqsScope}
The scope of the requirements includes determining the safety of a glass slab under a blast loading following the ASTM standard (\cite{astm2009}).

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:ReaderChars}
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of second year calculus, structural mechanics, glass breakage, blast risk, computer applications in civil engineering, and applicable standards for constructions using glass from \cite{astm2009}, \cite{astm2012}, and \cite{astm2016} in \hyperref[Sec:References]{Section: References}. The users of GlassBR can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in \hyperref[Sec:UserChars]{Section: User Characteristics}.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
\label{Sec:DocOrg}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by \cite{koothoor2013} and \cite{smithLai2005}, with some aspects taken from Volere template 16 \cite{rbrtsn2012}. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the data definitions in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models} and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The goal statements (\hyperref[Sec:GoalStmt]{Section: Goal Statements}) are refined to the theoretical models and the theoretical models (\hyperref[Sec:TMs]{Section: Theoretical Models}) to the instance models (\hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models}). The data definitions are used to support the definitions of the different models.

\end{itemize}
\item{GlassBR Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters input instead of a floating point number.}
\item{Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints.}
\item{Predict whether the glass slab is safe or not.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific System Description}
\label{Sec:SpecSystDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.

\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{Sec:ProbDesc}
A system is needed to efficiently and correctly predict whether a glass slab can withstand a blast under given conditions.

\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}
\label{Sec:TermDefs}
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements. All of the terms are extracted from \cite{astm2009} in \hyperref[Sec:References]{Section: References}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Glass breakage - The fracture or breakage of any lite or ply in monolithic, laminated, or insulating glass.}
\item{Lateral - Perpendicular to the glass surface.}
\item{Lite - Pieces of glass that are cut, prepared, and used to create the window or door.}
\item{Specifying authority - The design professional responsible for interpreting applicable regulations of authorities having jurisdiction and considering appropriate site specific factors to determine the appropriate values used to calculate the specified design load, and furnishing other information required to perform this practice.}
\item{Blast resistant glazing - Glazing that provides protection against air blast pressure generated by explosions.}
\item{Equivalent TNT charge mass - Mass of TNT placed on the ground in a hemisphere that represents the design explosive threat.}
\item{Glass Type:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Annealed (AN) - A flat, monolithic, glass lite which has uniform thickness where the residual surface stresses are almost zero, as defined in \cite{astm2016}.}
\item{Fully tempered (FT) - A flat, monolithic, glass lite of uniform thickness that has been subjected to a special heat treatment process where the residual surface compression is not less than 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or the edge compression not less than 67 MPa (9700 psi), as defined in \cite{astm2012}.}
\item{Heat strengthened (HS) - A flat, monolithic, glass lite of uniform thickness that has been subjected to a special heat treatment process where the residual surface compression is not less than 24 MPa (3500psi) or greater than 52 MPa (7500 psi), as defined in \cite{astm2012}.}
\end{itemize}
\item{Load - A uniformly distributed lateral pressure.}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Load resistance (LR) - The uniform lateral load that a glass construction can sustain based upon a given probability of breakage and load duration as defined in \cite[(pp. 1 and 53)]{astm2009}.}
\item{Non-factored load (NFL) - Three second duration uniform load associated with a probability of breakage less than or equal to 8 lites per 1000 for monolithic AN glass.}
\item{Glass weight load - The dead load component of the glass weight.}
\item{Short duration load - Any load lasting 3 seconds or less.}
\item{Specified design load - The magnitude in Pa (psf), type (for example, wind or snow) and duration of the load given by the specifying authority.}
\item{Long duration load - Any load lasting approximately 30 days.}
\end{itemize}
\item{Stand off distance (SD) - The distance from the glazing surface to the centroid of a hemispherical high explosive charge. It is represented by the coordinates (${SD_{\text{x}}}$, ${SD_{\text{y}}}$, ${SD_{\text{z}}}$).}
\item{Load share factor (LSF) - A multiplying factor derived from the load sharing between the double glazing, of equal or different thicknesses and types (including the layered behaviour of LG under long duration loads), in a sealed IG unit.}
\item{Glass type factor (GTF) - A multiplying factor for adjusting the LR of different glass type, that is, AN, FT, or HS, in monolithic glass, LG (Laminated Glass), or IG (Insulating Glass) constructions.}
\item{Aspect ratio (AR) - The ratio of the long dimension of the glass to the short dimension of the glass. For glass supported on four sides, the aspect ratio is always equal to or greater than 1.0. For glass supported on three sides, the ratio of the length of one of the supported edges perpendicular to the free edge, to the length of the free edge, is equal to or greater than 0.5.}
\item{Probability of breakage (${P_{\text{b}}}$) - The fraction of glass lites or plies that would break at the first occurrence of a specified load and duration, typically expressed in lites per 1000 (\cite{astm2016}).}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Physical System Description}
\label{Sec:PhysSyst}
The physical system of GlassBR, as shown in \hyperref[Figure:physSystImage]{Fig:physSystImage}, includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item[PS1:]{The glass slab.}
\item[PS2:]{The point of explosion. Where the bomb, or any kind of man-made explosion, is located. The stand off distance is the distance between the point of explosion and the glass.}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/GlassBR/physicalsystimage.png}
\caption{The physical system}
\label{Figure:physSystImage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\label{Sec:GoalStmt}
Given the dimensions of the glass plane, the glass type, the characteristics of the explosion, and the tolerable probability of breakage, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Predict-Glass-Withstands-Explosion:\phantomsection\label{willBreakGS}]{Analyze and predict whether the glass slab under consideration will be able to withstand the explosion of a certain degree which is calculated based on user input.}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\label{Sec:SolCharSpec}
The instance models that govern GlassBR are presented in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models}. The information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\label{Sec:Assumps}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical models by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The assumptions refine the scope by providing more detail.

\begin{itemize}
\item[glassType:\phantomsection\label{assumpGT}]{The standard E1300-09a for calculation applies only to monolithic, laminated, or insulating glass constructions of rectangular shape with continuous lateral support along one, two, three, or four edges. This practice assumes that: (1) the supported glass edges for two, three and four-sided support conditions are simply supported and free to slip in plane; (2) glass supported on two sides acts as a simply supported beam; and (3) glass supported on one side acts as a cantilever.}
\item[glassCondition:\phantomsection\label{assumpGC}]{Following \cite[(pg. 1)]{astm2009}, this practice does not apply to any form of wired, patterned, etched, sandblasted, drilled, notched, or grooved glass with surface and edge treatments that alter the glass strength. (RefBy: \hyperref[accAlteredGlass]{UC: Accommodate-Altered-Glass}.)}
\item[explainScenario:\phantomsection\label{assumpES}]{This system only considers the external explosion scenario for its calculations. (RefBy: \hyperref[calcInternalBlastRisk]{LC: Calculate-Internal-Blask-Risk}.)}
\item[standardValues:\phantomsection\label{assumpSV}]{The values provided in \hyperref[Sec:AuxConstants]{Section: Values of Auxiliary Constants} are assumed for the duration of load (${t_{\text{d}}}$), and the material properties of $m$, $k$, and $E$. (RefBy: \hyperref[varValsOfmkE]{LC: Variable-Values-of-m,k,E}, \hyperref[DD:sdfTol]{DD: sdfTol}, \hyperref[DD:nFL]{DD: nFL}, \hyperref[DD:loadDurFactor]{DD: loadDurFactor}, \hyperref[DD:dimlessLoad]{DD: dimlessLoad}, and \hyperref[assumpLDFC]{A: ldfConstant}.)}
\item[glassLite:\phantomsection\label{assumpGL}]{Glass under consideration is assumed to be a single lite; hence, the value of LSF is equal to 1 for all calculations in GlassBR. (RefBy: \hyperref[DD:calofCapacity]{DD: calofCapacity}, \hyperref[DD:dimlessLoad]{DD: dimlessLoad}, and \hyperref[accMoreThanSingleLite]{LC: Accomodate-More-than-Single-Lite}.)}
\item[boundaryConditions:\phantomsection\label{assumpBC}]{Boundary conditions for the glass slab are assumed to be 4-sided support for calculations. (RefBy: \hyperref[accMoreBoundaryConditions]{LC: Accomodate-More-Boundary-Conditions}.)}
\item[responseType:\phantomsection\label{assumpRT}]{The response type considered in GlassBR is flexural. (RefBy: \hyperref[considerMoreThanFlexGlass]{LC: Consider-More-than-Flexure-Glass}.)}
\item[ldfConstant:\phantomsection\label{assumpLDFC}]{With reference to \hyperref[assumpSV]{A: standardValues}, the value of load duration factor ($LDF$) is a constant in GlassBR. (RefBy: \hyperref[varValsOfmkE]{LC: Variable-Values-of-m,k,E} and \hyperref[DD:loadDurFactor]{DD: loadDurFactor}.)}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}
\label{Sec:TMs}
This section focuses on the general equations and laws that GlassBR is based on.

\subsubsection{Instance Models}
\label{Sec:IMs}
This section transforms the problem defined in \hyperref[Sec:ProbDesc]{Section: Problem Description} into one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined in \hyperref[Sec:DDs]{Section: Data Definitions} to replace the abstract symbols in the models identified in \hyperref[Sec:TMs]{Section: Theoretical Models} and \hyperref[Sec:GDs]{Section: General Definitions}.

The goal \hyperref[willBreakGS]{GS: Predict-Glass-Withstands-Explosion} is met by \hyperref[IM:isSafePb]{IM: isSafePb}, \hyperref[IM:isSafeLR]{IM: isSafeLR}.

\subsubsection{Data Constraints}
\label{Sec:DataConstraints}
\hyperref[Table:InDataConstraints]{Table:InDataConstraints} shows the data constraints on the input variables. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. \hyperref[Sec:AuxConstants]{Section: Values of Auxiliary Constants} gives the values of the specification parameters used in \hyperref[Table:InDataConstraints]{Table:InDataConstraints}.

\item[Portable:\phantomsection\label{portable}]{The code is able to be run in different environments.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Likely Changes}
\label{Sec:LCs}
This section lists the likely changes to be made to the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Calculate-Internal-Blask-Risk:\phantomsection\label{calcInternalBlastRisk}]{\hyperref[assumpES]{A: explainScenario} - The system currently only calculates for external blast risk. In the future, calculations can be added for the internal blast risk.}
\item[Variable-Values-of-m,k,E:\phantomsection\label{varValsOfmkE}]{\hyperref[assumpSV]{A: standardValues}, \hyperref[assumpLDFC]{A: ldfConstant} - Currently, the values for $m$, $k$, and $E$ are assumed to be the same for all glass. In the future, these values can be changed to variable inputs.}
\item[Accomodate-More-than-Single-Lite:\phantomsection\label{accMoreThanSingleLite}]{\hyperref[assumpGL]{A: glassLite} - The software may be changed to accommodate more than a single lite.}
\item[Accomodate-More-Boundary-Conditions:\phantomsection\label{accMoreBoundaryConditions}]{\hyperref[assumpBC]{A: boundaryConditions} - The software may be changed to accommodate more boundary conditions than 4-sided support.}
\item[Consider-More-than-Flexure-Glass:\phantomsection\label{considerMoreThanFlexGlass}]{\hyperref[assumpRT]{A: responseType} - The software may be changed to consider more than just flexure of the glass.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Unlikely Changes}
\label{Sec:UCs}
This section lists the unlikely changes to be made to the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Predict-Withstanding-of-Certain-Degree:\phantomsection\label{predictWithstandOfCertDeg}]{The goal of the system is to predict whether the glass slab under consideration can withstand an explosion of a certain degree.}
\item[Accommodate-Altered-Glass:\phantomsection\label{accAlteredGlass}]{\hyperref[assumpGC]{A: glassCondition} requires that the glass is not altered in any way. Therefore, this cannot be used on altered glass.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}
\label{Sec:TraceMatrices}
The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an ``X'' should be modified as well. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatAvsAll]{Table:TraceMatAvsAll} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatRefvsRef]{Table:TraceMatRefvsRef} shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. \hyperref[Table:TraceMatAllvsR]{Table:TraceMatAllvsR} shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models.
