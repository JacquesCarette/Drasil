\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Intro}
Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems incorporating phase change material (PCM) use a renewable energy source and provide a novel way of storing energy. Solar water heating systems incorporating PCM improve over the traditional solar water heating systems because of their smaller size. The smaller size is possible because of the ability of PCM to store thermal energy as latent heat, which allows higher thermal energy storage capacity per unit weight.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\label{Sec:DocPurpose}
The main purpose of this document is to describe the modelling of solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. The goal statements and theoretical models used in the SWHS code are provided, with an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions and unambiguous definitions. This document is intended to be used as a reference to provide ad hoc access to all information necessary to understand and verify the model. The SRS is abstract because the contents say what problem is being solved, but do not say how to solve it.

This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out \cite{parnasClements1986}, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to ``fake'' a rational design process.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
\label{Sec:ReqsScope}
The scope of the requirements includes thermal analysis of a single solar water heating tank incorporating PCM. This entire document is written assuming that the substances inside the solar water heating tank are water and PCM.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
\label{Sec:ReaderChars}
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of heat transfer theory from level 3 or 4 mechanical engineering and differential equations from level 1 and 2 calculus. The users of SWHS can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in \hyperref[Sec:UserChars]{Section: User Characteristics}.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
\label{Sec:DocOrg}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by \cite{dParnas1972} and \cite{parnasClements1984}. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models} and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The goal statements (\hyperref[Sec:GoalStmt]{Section: Goal Statements}) are refined to the theoretical models and the theoretical models (\hyperref[Sec:TMs]{Section: Theoretical Models}) to the instance models (\hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models}). The instance models to be solved are referred to as \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}, \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM: heatEInWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:heatEInPCM]{IM: heatEInPCM}. The instance models provide the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and algebraic equations that model the solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. SWHS solves these ODEs.

\section{General System Description}
\label{Sec:GenSysDesc}
This section provides general information about the system. It identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user characteristics, and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}
\label{Sec:SysContext}
\hyperref[Figure:SysCon]{Fig:SysCon} shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SWHS). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/SWHS/SystemContextFigure.png}
\caption{\hyperref[Figure:SysCon]{Fig:SysCon}: System Context}
\label{Figure:SysCon}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
SWHS is mostly self-contained. The only external interaction is through the user interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{User Responsibilities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Provide the input data to the system, ensuring no errors in the data entry}
\item{Take care that consistent units are used for input variables}
\end{itemize}
\item{SWHS Responsibilities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a floating point number}
\item{Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints}
\item{Calculate the required outputs}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{Sec:UserChars}
The end user of SWHS should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1 Calculus and Physics.

\subsection{System Constraints}
\label{Sec:SysConstraints}
There are no system constraints.

\section{Specific System Description}
\label{Sec:SpecSystDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.

\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{Sec:ProbDesc}
A system is needed to investigate the effect of employing PCM within a solar water heating tank.

\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}
\label{Sec:TermDefs}
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Heat flux: The rate of thermal energy transfer through a given surface per unit time.}
\item{Phase change material: A substance that uses phase changes (such as melting) to absorb or release large amounts of heat at a constant temperature.}
\item{Specific heat capacity: The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the unit mass of a given substance by a given amount.}
\item{Thermal conduction: The transfer of heat energy through a substance.}
\item{Transient: Changing with time.}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Physical System Description}
\label{Sec:PhysSyst}
The physical system of SWHS, as shown in \hyperref[Figure:Tank]{Fig:Tank}, includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item[PS1:]{Tank containing water.}
\item[PS2:]{Heating coil at bottom of tank. (${q_{\text{C}}}$ represents the heat flux into the water from the coil.)}
\item[PS3:]{PCM suspended in tank. (${q_{\text{P}}}$ represents the heat flux into the PCM from water.)}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../../datafiles/SWHS/Tank.png}
\caption{Solar water heating tank, with heat flux into the water from the coil of ${q_{\text{C}}}$ and heat flux into the PCM from water of ${q_{\text{P}}}$}
\label{Figure:Tank}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\label{Sec:GoalStmt}
Given the temperature of the heating coil, the initial conditions for the temperature of the water and the temperature of the phase change material, and the material properties, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Predict-Water-Temperature:\phantomsection\label{waterTempGS}]{Predict the temperature of the water over time.}
\item[Predict-PCM-Temperature:\phantomsection\label{pcmTempGS}]{Predict the temperature of the phase change material over time.}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\label{Sec:SolCharSpec}
The instance models that govern SWHS are presented in \hyperref[Sec:IMs]{Section: Instance Models}. The information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\label{Sec:Assumps}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical models by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The assumptions refine the scope by providing more detail.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Thermal-Energy-Only:\phantomsection\label{assumpTEO}]{The only form of energy that is relevant for this problem is thermal energy. All other forms of energy, such as mechanical energy, are assumed to be negligible. (RefBy: \hyperref[TM:consThermE]{TM: consThermE}.)}
\item[Heat-Transfer-Coeffs-Constant:\phantomsection\label{assumpHTCC}]{All heat transfer coefficients are constant over time. (RefBy: \hyperref[TM:nwtnCooling]{TM: nwtnCooling}.)}
\item[Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank:\phantomsection\label{assumpCWTAT}]{The water in the tank is fully mixed, so the temperature of the water is the same throughout the entire tank. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}.)}
\item[Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume:\phantomsection\label{assumpTPCAV}]{The temperature of the phase change material is the same throughout the volume of PCM. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp}, \hyperref[likeChgUTP]{LC: Uniform-Temperature-PCM}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}.)}
\item[Density-Water-PCM-Constant-over-Volume:\phantomsection\label{assumpDWPCoV}]{The density of water and density of PCM have no spatial variation; that is, they are each constant over their entire volume. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp}.)}
\item[Specific-Heat-Energy-Constant-over-Volume:\phantomsection\label{assumpSHECov}]{The specific heat capacity of water, specific heat capacity of PCM as a solid, and specific heat capacity of PCM as a liquid have no spatial variation; that is, they are each constant over their entire volume. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp}.)}
\item[Newton-Law-Convective-Cooling-Coil-Water:\phantomsection\label{assumpLCCCW}]{Newton's law of convective cooling applies between the heating coil and the water. (RefBy: \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD: htFluxWaterFromCoil}.)}

\item[Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge:\phantomsection\label{assumpCTNOD}]{The model only accounts for charging of the tank, not discharging. The temperature of the water and temperature of the phase change material can only increase, or remain constant; they do not decrease. This implies that the initial temperature \hyperref[assumpSITWP]{A: Same-Initial-Temp-Water-PCM} is less than (or equal) to the temperature of the heating coil. (RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgDT]{LC: Discharging-Tank} and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}.)}

(RefBy: \hyperref[likeChgDITPW]{LC: Different-Initial-Temps-PCM-Water}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}, and \hyperref[assumpCTNOD]{A: Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge}.)}

\item[Water-Always-Liquid:\phantomsection\label{assumpWAL}]{The operating temperature range of the system is such that the water is always in liquid state. That is, the temperature will not drop below the melting point temperature of water, or rise above its boiling point temperature. (RefBy: \hyperref[unlikeChgWPFS]{UC: Water-PCM-Fixed-States}, \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM: heatEInWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}.)}

\item[No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water-PCM:\phantomsection\label{assumpNIHGBWP}]{No internal heat is generated by either the water or the PCM; therefore, the volumetric heat generation per unit volume is zero. (RefBy: \hyperref[unlikeChgNIHG]{UC: No-Internal-Heat-Generation}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}.)}
\item[Volume-Change-Melting-PCM-Negligible:\phantomsection\label{assumpVCMPN}]{The volume change of the PCM due to melting is negligible. (RefBy: \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}.)}

(RefBy: \hyperref[unlikeChgWPFS]{UC: Water-PCM-Fixed-States}, \hyperref[unlikeChgNGS]{UC: No-Gaseous-State}, \hyperref[IM:heatEInPCM]{IM: heatEInPCM}, and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}.)}
\item[Atmospheric-Pressure-Tank:\phantomsection\label{assumpAPT}]{The pressure in the tank is atmospheric, so the melting point temperature and boiling point temperature are 0${}^{\circ}$C and 100${}^{\circ}$C, respectively. (RefBy: \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM: heatEInWtr} and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}.)}
\item[Volume-Coil-Negligible:\phantomsection\label{assumpVCN}]{When considering the volume of water in the tank, the volume of the heating coil is assumed to be negligible. (RefBy: \hyperref[findMass]{FR: Find-Mass}.)}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Detailed derivation of simplified rate of change of temperature:}
\label{GD:rocTempSimpDeriv}
Integrating \hyperref[TM:consThermE]{TM: consThermE} over a volume ($V$), we have:

\begin{displaymath}
-\int_{V}{∇\cdot{}\mathbf{q}}\,dV+\int_{V}{g}\,dV=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
Applying Gauss's Divergence Theorem to the first term over the surface $S$ of the volume, with $\mathbf{q}$ as the thermal flux vector for the surface and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ as a unit outward normal vector for a surface:

\begin{displaymath}
-\int_{S}{\mathbf{q}\cdot{}\mathbf{\hat{n}}}\,dS+\int_{V}{g}\,dV=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
We consider an arbitrary volume. The volumetric heat generation per unit volume is assumed constant. Then Equation (1) can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V=\int_{V}{ρ C \frac{\,\partial{}T}{\,\partial{}t}}\,dV
\end{displaymath}
Where ${q_{\text{in}}}$, ${q_{\text{out}}}$, ${A_{\text{in}}}$, and ${A_{\text{out}}}$ are explained in \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp}. The integral over the surface could be simplified because the thermal flux is assumed constant over ${A_{\text{in}}}$ and ${A_{\text{out}}}$ and $0$ on all other surfaces. Outward flux is considered positive. Assuming $ρ$, $C$, and $T$ are constant over the volume, which is true in our case by \hyperref[assumpCWTAT]{A: Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank}, \hyperref[assumpTPCAV]{A: Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume}, \hyperref[assumpDWPCoV]{A: Density-Water-PCM-Constant-over-Volume}, and \hyperref[assumpSHECov]{A: Specific-Heat-Energy-Constant-over-Volume}, we have:

\begin{displaymath}
ρ C V \frac{\,dT}{\,dt}={q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V
\end{displaymath}
Using the fact that $ρ$=$m$/$V$, Equation (2) can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
m C \frac{\,dT}{\,dt}={q_{\text{in}}} {A_{\text{in}}}-{q_{\text{out}}} {A_{\text{out}}}+g V

\subsubsection{Instance Models}
\label{Sec:IMs}
This section transforms the problem defined in \hyperref[Sec:ProbDesc]{Section: Problem Description} into one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined in \hyperref[Sec:DDs]{Section: Data Definitions} to replace the abstract symbols in the models identified in \hyperref[Sec:TMs]{Section: Theoretical Models} and \hyperref[Sec:GDs]{Section: General Definitions}.

The goals \hyperref[waterTempGS]{GS: Predict-Water-Temperature}, \hyperref[pcmTempGS]{GS: Predict-PCM-Temperature}, \hyperref[waterEnergyGS]{GS: Predict-Water-Energy}, and \hyperref[pcmEnergyGS]{GS: Predict-PCM-Energy} are solved by \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}, \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM}, \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM: heatEInWtr}, and \hyperref[IM:heatEInPCM]{IM: heatEInPCM}. The solutions for \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr} and \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM} are coupled since the solutions for ${T_{\text{W}}}$ and ${T_{\text{P}}}$ depend on one another. \hyperref[IM:heatEInWtr]{IM: heatEInWtr} can be solved once \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr} has been solved. The solutions of \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnPCM]{IM: eBalanceOnPCM} and \hyperref[IM:heatEInPCM]{IM: heatEInPCM} are also coupled, since the temperature of the phase change material and the change in heat energy in the PCM depend on the phase change.

\paragraph{Detailed derivation of the energy balance on water:}
\label{IM:eBalanceOnWtrDeriv}
To find the rate of change of ${T_{\text{W}}}$, we look at the energy balance on water. The volume being considered is the volume of water in the tank ${V_{\text{W}}}$, which has mass ${m_{\text{W}}}$ and specific heat capacity, ${C_{\text{W}}}$. Heat transfer occurs in the water from the heating coil as ${q_{\text{C}}}$ (\hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD: htFluxWaterFromCoil}) and from the water into the PCM as ${q_{\text{P}}}$ (\hyperref[GD:htFluxPCMFromWater]{GD: htFluxPCMFromWater}), over areas ${A_{\text{C}}}$ and ${A_{\text{P}}}$, respectively. The thermal flux is constant over ${A_{\text{C}}}$, since the temperature of the heating coil is assumed to not vary along its length (\hyperref[assumpTHCCoL]{A: Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length}), and the thermal flux is constant over ${A_{\text{P}}}$, since the temperature of the PCM is the same throughout its volume (\hyperref[assumpTPCAV]{A: Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume}) and the water is fully mixed (\hyperref[assumpCWTAT]{A: Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank}). No heat transfer occurs to the outside of the tank, since it has been assumed to be perfectly insulated (\hyperref[assumpPIT]{A: Perfect-Insulation-Tank}). Since the assumption is made that no internal heat is generated (\hyperref[assumpNIHGBWP]{A: No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water-PCM}), $g=0$. Therefore, the equation for \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp} can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}={q_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}-{q_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}
\end{displaymath}
Using \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD: htFluxWaterFromCoil} for ${q_{\text{C}}}$ and \hyperref[GD:htFluxPCMFromWater]{GD: htFluxPCMFromWater} for ${q_{\text{P}}}$, this can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}={h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)-{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}-{T_{\text{P}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Dividing Equation (2) by ${m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}$, we obtain:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)-\frac{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}-{T_{\text{P}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Factoring the negative sign out of the second term of the RHS of Equation (3) and multiplying it by ${h_{\text{C}}}$ ${A_{\text{C}}}$ / ${h_{\text{C}}}$ ${A_{\text{C}}}$ yields:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)+\frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}} \frac{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{P}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Rearraging this equation gives us:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)+\frac{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}}{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}} \frac{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}}}{{m_{\text{W}}} {C_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{P}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
By substituting ${τ_{\text{W}}}$ (from \hyperref[DD:balanceDecayRate]{DD: balanceDecayRate}) and $η$ (from \hyperref[DD:balanceDecayTime]{DD: balanceDecayTime}), this can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{1}{{τ_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)+\frac{η}{{τ_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{P}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Finally, factoring out $\frac{1}{{τ_{\text{W}}}}$, we are left with the governing ODE for \hyperref[IM:eBalanceOnWtr]{IM: eBalanceOnWtr}:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{W}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{1}{{τ_{\text{W}}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}+η \left({T_{\text{P}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\right)\right)

\paragraph{Detailed derivation of the energy balance on the PCM during sensible heating phase:}
\label{IM:eBalanceOnPCMDeriv}
To find the rate of change of ${T_{\text{P}}}$, we look at the energy balance on the PCM. The volume being considered is the volume of PCM (${V_{\text{P}}}$). The derivation that follows is initially for the solid PCM. The mass of phase change material is ${m_{\text{P}}}$ and the specific heat capacity of PCM as a solid is ${{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$. The heat flux into the PCM from water is ${q_{\text{P}}}$ (\hyperref[GD:htFluxPCMFromWater]{GD: htFluxPCMFromWater}) over phase change material surface area ${A_{\text{P}}}$. The thermal flux is constant over ${A_{\text{P}}}$, since the temperature of the PCM is the same throughout its volume (\hyperref[assumpTPCAV]{A: Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume}) and the water is fully mixed (\hyperref[assumpCWTAT]{A: Constant-Water-Temp-Across-Tank}). There is no heat flux output from the PCM. Assuming no volumetric heat generation per unit volume (\hyperref[assumpNIHGBWP]{A: No-Internal-Heat-Generation-By-Water-PCM}), $g=0$, the equation for \hyperref[GD:rocTempSimp]{GD: rocTempSimp} can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{P}}} {{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{P}}}}{\,dt}={q_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}
\end{displaymath}
Using \hyperref[GD:htFluxPCMFromWater]{GD: htFluxPCMFromWater} for ${q_{\text{P}}}$, this equation can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
{m_{\text{P}}} {{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}} \frac{\,d{T_{\text{P}}}}{\,dt}={h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}-{T_{\text{P}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Dividing by ${m_{\text{P}}}$ ${{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$ we obtain:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{P}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}}}{{m_{\text{P}}} {{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}-{T_{\text{P}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
By substituting ${{τ_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$ (from \hyperref[DD:balanceSolidPCM]{DD: balanceSolidPCM}), this can be written as:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\,d{T_{\text{P}}}}{\,dt}=\frac{1}{{{τ_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}-{T_{\text{P}}}\right)
\end{displaymath}
Equation (4) applies for the solid PCM. In the case where all of the PCM is melted, the same derivation applies, except that ${{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$ is replaced by ${{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{L}}}$, and thus ${{τ_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$ is replaced by ${{τ_{\text{P}}}^{\text{L}}}$. Although a small change in surface area would be expected with melting, this is not included, since the volume change of the PCM with melting is assumed to be negligible (\hyperref[assumpVCMPN]{A: Volume-Change-Melting-PCM-Negligible}).

In the case where ${T_{\text{P}}}={{T_{\text{melt}}}^{\text{P}}}$ and not all of the PCM is melted, the temperature of the phase change material does not change. Therefore, d ${T_{\text{P}}}$ / d $t$ = 0.

This derivation does not consider the boiling of the PCM, as the PCM is assumed to either be in a solid state or a liquid state (\hyperref[assumpNGSP]{A: No-Gaseous-State-PCM}).

Notes & The above equation is derived using \hyperref[TM:sensHtE]{TM: sensHtE} and \hyperref[TM:latentHtE]{TM: latentHtE}.
        
        ${E_{\text{P}}}$ for the solid PCM is found using \hyperref[TM:sensHtE]{TM: sensHtE} for sensible heating, with the specific heat capacity of the solid PCM, ${{C_{\text{P}}}^{\text{S}}}$ ($\frac{\text{J}}{(\text{kg}{}^{\circ}\text{C})}$) and the change in the PCM temperature from the initial temperature (${}^{\circ}$C).
        
        ${E_{\text{P}}}$ for the melted PCM (${T_{\text{P}}}>{{{E_{\text{P}}}_{\text{melt}}}^{\text{init}}}$) is found using \hyperref[TM:sensHtE]{TM: sensHtE} for sensible heat of the liquid PCM plus the energy when melting starts, plus the energy required to melt all of the PCM.
        
        The energy required to melt all of the PCM is ${H_{\text{f}}} {m_{\text{P}}}$ (J) (from \hyperref[DD:htFusion]{DD: htFusion}).
        
        The change in temperature is ${T_{\text{P}}}-{{T_{\text{melt}}}^{\text{P}}}$ (${}^{\circ}$C).
        
        ${E_{\text{P}}}$ during melting of the PCM is found using the energy required at the instant melting of the PCM begins, ${{{E_{\text{P}}}_{\text{melt}}}^{\text{init}}}$ plus the latent heat energy added to the PCM, ${Q_{\text{P}}}$ (J) since the time when melting began ${{t_{\text{melt}}}^{\text{init}}}$ (s).
        
        The heat energy for boiling of the PCM is not detailed, since the PCM is assumed to either be in a solid or liquid state (\hyperref[assumpNGSP]{A: No-Gaseous-State-PCM}) (\hyperref[assumpPIS]{A: PCM-Initially-Solid}).

\subsubsection{Data Constraints}
\label{Sec:DataConstraints}
\hyperref[Table:InDataConstraints]{Table:InDataConstraints} shows the data constraints on the input variables. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The column for software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values. (*) These quantities cannot be equal to zero, or there will be a divide by zero in the model. (+) These quantities cannot be zero, or there would be freezing (\hyperref[assumpPIS]{A: PCM-Initially-Solid}). (++) The constraints on the surface area are calculated by considering the surface area to volume ratio. The assumption is that the lowest ratio is 1 and the highest possible is $\frac{2}{{h_{\text{min}}}}$, where ${h_{\text{min}}}$ is the thickness of a ``sheet'' of PCM. A thin sheet has the greatest surface area to volume ratio. (**) The constraint on the maximum time at the end of the simulation is the total number of seconds in one day.

A correct solution must exhibit the law of conservation of energy. This means that the change in heat energy in the water should equal the difference between the total energy input from the heating coil and the energy output to the PCM. This can be shown as an equation by taking \hyperref[GD:htFluxWaterFromCoil]{GD: htFluxWaterFromCoil} and \hyperref[GD:htFluxPCMFromWater]{GD: htFluxPCMFromWater}, multiplying each by their respective surface area of heat transfer, and integrating each over the simulation time, as follows:

\begin{displaymath}
{E_{\text{W}}}=\int_{0}^{t}{{h_{\text{C}}} {A_{\text{C}}} \left({T_{\text{C}}}-{T_{\text{W}}}\left(t\right)\right)}\,dt-\int_{0}^{t}{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}\left(t\right)-{T_{\text{P}}}\left(t\right)\right)}\,dt
\end{displaymath}
In addition, the change in heat energy in the PCM should equal the energy input to the PCM from the water. This can be expressed as

\begin{displaymath}
{E_{\text{P}}}=\int_{0}^{t}{{h_{\text{P}}} {A_{\text{P}}} \left({T_{\text{W}}}\left(t\right)-{T_{\text{P}}}\left(t\right)\right)}\,dt
\end{displaymath}
Equations (FIXME: Equation 7) and (FIXME: Equation 8) can be used as ``sanity'' checks to gain confidence in any solution computed by SWHS. The relative error between the results computed by SWHS and the results calculated from the RHS of these equations should be less than ${C_{\text{tol}}}$ \hyperref[verifyEnergyOutput]{FR: Verify-Energy-Output-Follow-Conservation-of-Energy}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Uniform-Temperature-PCM:\phantomsection\label{likeChgUTP}]{\hyperref[assumpTPCAV]{A: Temp-PCM-Constant-Across-Volume} - PCM is actually a poor thermal conductor, so the assumption of uniform temperature of the phase change material is not likely.}
\item[Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Day:\phantomsection\label{likeChgTCVOD}]{\hyperref[assumpTHCCoT]{A: Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Time} - The temperature of the heating coil will change over the course of the day, depending on the energy received from the sun.}
\item[Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Length:\phantomsection\label{likeChgTCVOL}]{\hyperref[assumpTHCCoL]{A: Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length} - The temperature of the heating coil will actually change along its length as the water within it cools.}
\item[Discharging-Tank:\phantomsection\label{likeChgDT}]{\hyperref[assumpCTNOD]{A: Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge} - The model currently only accounts for charging of the tank. A more complete model would also account for discharging of the tank.}
\item[Different-Initial-Temps-PCM-Water:\phantomsection\label{likeChgDITPW}]{\hyperref[assumpSITWP]{A: Same-Initial-Temp-Water-PCM} - To add more flexibility to the simulation, the initial temperature of the water and the PCM could be allowed to have different values.}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Water-PCM-Fixed-States:\phantomsection\label{unlikeChgWPFS}]{\hyperref[assumpWAL]{A: Water-Always-Liquid}, \hyperref[assumpNGSP]{A: No-Gaseous-State-PCM} - It is unlikely for the change of water from liquid to a solid or the state change of the phase change material from a liquid to a gas to be considered.}
