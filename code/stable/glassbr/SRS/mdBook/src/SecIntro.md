# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

Explosions in downtown areas are dangerous from the blast itself and also potentially from the secondary effect of falling glass. Therefore, software is needed to predict whether a glass slab can withstand a blast under given conditions. For example, we might wish to know whether a pane of glass fails from a gas main explosion or from a small fertilizer truck bomb. The document describes the program called GlassBR , which is based on the original, manually created version of [GlassBR](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/main/CaseStudies/glass).

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for GlassBR. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
