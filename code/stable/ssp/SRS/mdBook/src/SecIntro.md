# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in significant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program (SSP). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
