# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

Projectile motion is a common problem in physics. Therefore, it is useful to have a program to solve and model these types of problems. Common examples of projectile motion include ballistics problems (missiles, bullets, etc.) and the flight of balls in various sports (baseball, golf, football, etc.). The document describes the program called Projectile Motion Analysis , which is based on the original, manually created version of [Projectile](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/master/CaseStudies/projectile).

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Projectile Motion Analysis. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
