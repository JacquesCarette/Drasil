\section{Introduction}

Due to the rising cost of developing video games, developers are looking for
ways to save time and money on their projects. Using an open source physics
library that is reliable and free will cut down development costs and lead 
to better quality products. \\
\newline
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) for Chipmunk2D, an open source 2D rigid body physics library. It explains the purpose of this document,
the scope of the system, and the organization of the document.

%2.1 Purpose of Document

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document describes the modeling of an open source
2D rigid body physics library used for games. The goals and theoretical
models used in Chipmunk2D are provided. This document is intended to be 
used as a reference to provide all necessary information to understand and verify
the model. \\
\newline
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development
phases, including the writing of the design specification and the software verification
and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are 
to be realized. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will 
be taken to increase confidence in the software documentation and 
implementation.

%2.2 Scope of Requirements
\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of the requirements includes the physical simulation of 2D rigid bodies 
acted on by forces. Given 2D rigid bodies, Chipmunk2D is intended to 
simulate how these rigid bodies interact with one another.

%2.3 Organization of Document
\subsection{Organization of Document}
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific
computing software proposed by~\cite{Koothoor2013} and \cite{SmithAndLai2005}.
The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories,
definitions, and assumptions.  For readers that would like a more bottom-up
approach, they can start reading the instance models in Section
\ref{sec_instance} and trace back to find any additional information they
require. \\
\newline
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and theoretical
models to the instance models.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system,
identifies the interfaces between the system and its environment, and describes
the user characteristics and system constraints.

%3.1 User Characteristics
\subsection{User Characteristics}

The end user of Chipmunk2D should have an understanding 
of first year programming concepts and of high school
physics.

%3.2 System Constraints
\subsection{System Constraints}

There are no system constraints.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which provides a high-level
view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution
characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, 
and definitions that are used for the physics library.

%4.1 Problem Description
\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

Creating a gaming physics library is a difficult task. Games need 
physics libraries that can simulate objects acting under various physical conditions, while simultaneously being fast and efficient enough to
work in soft real-time during the game. Developing a physics library from scratch
takes a long period of time and is very costly, presenting barriers of entry which make it difficult for game developers to include physics in their products. There are a few free, open-source and high quality physics libraries available to be used for consumer products (Section \ref{sec_otss}). By creating a simple, lightweight, fast, and portable 2D rigid body physics library, game development will be more accessible to the masses and higher quality products will be produced.

% 4.1.1 Terminology and Definitions
\subsubsection{Terminology and Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meanings, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item Rigid Body: a solid body in which deformation is neglected.
\item Elasticity: ratio of the velocities of two colliding objects after and
before the collision.
\item Center of Mass: the mean location of the distribution of mass of the object.
\item  Cartesian coordinates: a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.
\item  Right-handed coordinate system: a coordinate system where the positive z-axis comes out of the screen.

\end{itemize}

% 4.1.2 Goal Statements
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\begin{itemize}
	
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_linear}:] Given the physical properties, initial positions and velocities, and forces applied on a set of rigid bodies, determine their new positions and velocities over a period of time (IM\ref{IM_FT}).

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_angular}:] Given the physical properties, initial orientations and angular velocities, and forces applied on a set of rigid bodies, determine their new orientations and angular velocities over a period of time. (IM\ref{IM_FR}).

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum  \label{G_detectCollision}:] Given the initial positions and
velocities of a set of rigid bodies, determine if any of them will collide with one another over a period of time.

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum  \label{G_collision}:] Given the physical properties, initial linear and angular positions and velocities, determine the new positions and velocities over a period of time of rigid bodies that have undergone a collision (IM\ref{IM_C}).

\end{itemize}

%4.2 Solution Characteristics Specification

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_col}:] All rigid body collisions are vertex-to-edge collisions.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_damping}:] There is no damping involved throughout the simulation.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_constraints}:] There are no constraints and joints involved throughout the simulation.

\end{itemize}

%General Definition 2 - GD2 - Derivation
\subsubsection*{Derivation of the Conservation of Momentum}

When bodies collide, they exert an equal force on each other in opposite
directions. This is Newton's third law (T\ref{T_NTL}):
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F}_1 = - \mathbf{F}_2
\end{equation*}

\noindent
The objects collide with each other for the exact same amount of time $t$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_1t = - \mathbf{F}_2t \label{conservation1}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The above equation is equal to the impulse (GD\ref{GD_I}):
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F}_1t = \int \mathbf{F}_1 \, \dt = \mathbf{J}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
The impulse is equal to the change in momentum: 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}= \Delta\mathbf{P} = m\Delta\mathbf{v} \label{conservation2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Substituting \ref{conservation2} into \ref{conservation1} yields:
\begin{equation*}
m_1\Delta\mathbf{v}_1 = -m_2\Delta\mathbf{v}_2
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Expanding and rearranging the above formula gives:
\begin{equation*}
m_1\mathbf{v}_{\text{i}_1} + m_2\mathbf{v}_{\text{i}_2} = m_1\mathbf{v}_{\text{f}_1} + m_2\mathbf{v}_{\text{f}_2}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Generalizing for multiple ($k$) colliding objects: 
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{n} m_k\mathbf{v}_{\text{i}_k} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} m_k\mathbf{v}_{\text{f}_k}
\end{equation*}

% General Definition 3 - GD3 - Derivation

\subsubsection*{Derivation of Gravitational Acceleration}

From Newton's law of universal gravitation (T\ref{T_NUG}), we have:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = G\frac{m_1m_2}{||\mathbf{r}||^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}} \label{grav1}
\end{equation}

\noindent 
Equation \ref{grav1} governs the gravitational attraction between two bodies. Suppose that one of the bodies is significantly more massive than the other, so that we concern ourselves with the force the massive body exerts on the lighter body. Further suppose that the coordinate system is chosen such that this force acts on a line which lies along one of the principal axes (\aref{A_2d}). Then our unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{||\mathbf{r}||} = \mathbf{\hat{i}}$ or $\mathbf{\hat{j}}$ for the $x$ or $y$ axes (\aref{A_cartesian}), respectively. \\
\newline
Given the above assumptions, let $M$ and $m$ be the mass of the massive and light body, respectively. Using $\ref{grav1}$ and equating this with Newton's second law (T\ref{T_NSL}) for the force experienced by the light body, we get:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{g} = G\frac{Mm}{||\mathbf{r}||^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}} = m\mathbf{g} \label{grav2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\mathbf{g}$ is gravitational acceleration. Dividing \ref{grav2} by $m$, and resolving this into separate $x$ and $y$ components:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
G\frac{M}{||r_\mathrm{x}||^2}\mathbf{\hat{i}} & = -g_\mathrm{x}\mathbf{\hat{i}} \\
G\frac{M}{||r_\mathrm{y}||^2}\mathbf{\hat{j}} & = -g_\mathrm{y}\mathbf{\hat{j}} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Thus:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{g} = [-g_\mathrm{x}, -g_\mathrm{y}]
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection*{Derivation for Impulse for Collision Response}

Rearranging the equation for the coefficient of restitution (GD\ref{GD_COR}), we get:
$$\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AB}_\mathrm{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = -C_\mathrm{R}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AB}_\mathrm{i} \cdot \mathbf{n}$$
\noindent Expanding the relative velocity (GD\ref{GD_RV}) on the left:
$$(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AP}_\mathrm{f} - \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{BP}_\mathrm{f}) \cdot \mathbf{n} = -C_\mathrm{R}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AB}_\mathrm{i} \cdot \mathbf{n}$$
\noindent
Applying Chasles' Theorem (T\ref{T_CT}) and IM\ref{IM_C} on the left-hand side: 

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& (\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{f} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{f} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} - \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{f} - \boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{f} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \\
&\implies \bigg(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{i} + \frac{j}{m_\mathrm{A}}\mathbf{n} + \bigg(\boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{i} + \frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} \times j\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{A}}\bigg) \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} - \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i} + \frac{j}{m_\mathrm{B}}\mathbf{n} - \bigg(\boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i} - \frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP} \times j\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}}\bigg) \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP}\bigg) \cdot \mathbf{n}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\\
\noindent
Expanding and then collecting terms:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& \bigg[(\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{i} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{i} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP}) - (\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP}) \\
& + j\bigg(\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{1}{m_\mathrm{B}}\bigg)\mathbf{n} + j\bigg(\frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} \times \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP} \times \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}}\bigg)\bigg] \cdot \mathbf{n} \\
& \implies (\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AP}_\mathrm{i} - \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{BP}_\mathrm{i}) \cdot \mathbf{n} + j \bigg[\bigg(\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{1}{m_\mathrm{B}}\bigg)\mathbf{n} + \bigg(\frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} \times \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP} \times \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP}}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}}\bigg)\bigg] \cdot \mathbf{n} \\

Finally, equating the left and right-hand sides back together and rearranging for $j$, we obtain:
\\
\begin{equation*}
j = \frac{-(1 + C_\mathrm{R}) \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{AB}_\mathrm{i} \cdot \mathbf{n}}{\big(\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{1}{m_\mathrm{B}}\big)||\mathbf{n}||^2 + \frac{||\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{AP} \times \mathbf{n}||^2}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{A}} + \frac{||\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{BP} \times \mathbf{n}||^2}{\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}}}

one expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections \ref{sec_theoretical} and \ref{sec_gendef}. \\

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} and \ref{TblOutputVar} show the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively.  The ``Physical Constraints" column gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the
variable.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements: the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements: the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

%5.1 Functional Requirements
\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent
\begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Space}:] Create a space for all of the rigid bodies in the physical simulation 
to interact in.  
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Rigid}:] Input the initial mass, velocities, positions, orientations, angular velocities of, and forces applied on rigid bodies (\iref{IM_FT}, \iref{IM_FR}, \rref{R_CheckInputs}).
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Shape}:] Input the surface properties of the bodies, such as friction or elasticity (\iref{IM_C}, \rref{R_CheckInputs}),
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_CheckInputs}:] Verify that the inputs satisfy the required physical constraints (Section \ref{sec_DataConstraints}).
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Force}:] Determine the position and velocities over a period of time of the 2D
rigid bodies acted upon by a force (\iref{IM_FT}).
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Rotation}:] Determine the orientation and angular velocities over a period of time of
the 2D rigid bodies (\iref{IM_FR}).
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_CheckCollision}:] Determine if any of the rigid bodies in the space have collided (\rref{R_Space}).
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Collision}:] Determine the position and velocities over a period of time of 2D rigid
bodies that have undergone a collision (\iref{IM_C}, \rref{R_CheckCollision}).

\end{itemize} 

%5.2 Nonfunctional Requirements
\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
Games are resource-intensive, so performance is a high priority.
Other non-functional requirements that are a priority are: correctness,
understandability, portability, reliability, and maintainability.

\section{Likely Changes}    

This section lists the likely changes to be made to the physics game library.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_solver}:] The internal ODE-solving algorithm used by the library may change in the future.
	\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_collisions}:] The library may be expanded to deal with edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex collisions (A\ref{A_col}).

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs} \label{sec_tmag}

The purpose of traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an ``X" should be modified as well. Table \ref{RTraceMatrix} shows the dependencies of goal statements, requirements, instance models and data constraints with each other. Table \ref{ATraceMatrix} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions and instance models on the assumptions. Finally, Table \ref{ITraceMatrix} shows the dependencies of the theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions and instance models on each other. \\

\noindent
The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. Figure \ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of goal statements, requirements, instance models and data constraints with each other. Figure \ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions and instance models on the assumptions. Finally, Figure \ref{Fig_ITrace} shows the dependencies of the theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions and instance models on each other. Building a tool to automatically generate the graphical representation of the matrix by scanning the label and reference can be future work. \\
