# Terminology and Definitions {#Sec:TermDefs}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.

- Rigid body: A solid body in which deformation is neglected.
- Elasticity: The ratio of the relative velocities of two colliding objects after and before a collision.
- Centre of mass: The mean location of the distribution of mass of the object.
- Cartesian coordinate system: A coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length (from [cartesianWiki](./SecReferences.md#cartesianWiki)).
- Right-handed coordinate system: A coordinate system where the positive z-axis comes out of the screen..
- line: An interval between two points (from [lineSource](./SecReferences.md#lineSource)).
- point: An exact location, it has no size, only position (from [pointSource](./SecReferences.md#pointSource)).
- damping: An influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing, restricting or preventing its oscillations (from [dampingSource](./SecReferences.md#dampingSource)).
