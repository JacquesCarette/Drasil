Unless otherwise stated (through citation or otherwise), this thesis is the work
of my own (Jason Balaci). In particular, through Dr.\ Jacques Carette's project
aims, direction, and supervision, I was able to complete this work.

This thesis contributes to Drasil, a research project principally investigated
by Dr.\ Jacques Carette and Dr.\ Spencer Smith, and contributed to by many
fellow students before me.
