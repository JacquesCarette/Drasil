# Organization of Document {#Sec:DocOrg}

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [koothoor2013](./SecReferences.md#koothoor2013), [smithLai2005](./SecReferences.md#smithLai2005), [smithEtAl2007](./SecReferences.md#smithEtAl2007), and [smithKoothoor2016](./SecReferences.md#smithKoothoor2016). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [data definitions](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The [goal statements](./SecGoalStmt.md#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](./SecTMs.md#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs). The data definitions are used to support the definitions of the different models.
