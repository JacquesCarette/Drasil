# Organization of Document {#Sec:DocOrg}

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [koothoor2013](./SecReferences.md#koothoor2013), [smithLai2005](./SecReferences.md#smithLai2005), [smithEtAl2007](./SecReferences.md#smithEtAl2007), and [smithKoothoor2016](./SecReferences.md#smithKoothoor2016). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The [goal statements](./SecGoalStmt.md#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](./SecTMs.md#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs). The instance models to be solved are referred to as [IM:eBalanceOnWtr](./SecIMs.md#IM:eBalanceOnWtr), [IM:eBalanceOnPCM](./SecIMs.md#IM:eBalanceOnPCM), [IM:heatEInWtr](./SecIMs.md#IM:heatEInWtr), and [IM:heatEInPCM](./SecIMs.md#IM:heatEInPCM). The instance models provide the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and algebraic equations that model the solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. SWHS solves these ODEs.
