\chapter{Future Work}
\label{c:future}
\ds{This can probably be a section at the end of results / conclusion instead?}

Development of Drasil is ongoing and the framework is still being iterated upon
to date. In this section we present areas we believe have room for improvement
along with plans for additional features to be added in the long-term.

\section{Typed Expression Language}
- Will allow for much more in-depth sanity checking of generated \sfs{}

\section{Model types}

\section{Usability}
As mentioned in the results section, usability remains a great area for
improvement for Drasil. Work to create a visual front-end for the framework
has been planned and we hope to eventually get to the point of usability being
as simple as drag-and-drop or similar mechanisms.

Work on usability will address each of the core areas of development with
Drasil: knowledge-capture of system-agnostic information,
knowledge-capture of system-specific information, and recipe creation and
modification.

\ds{Developer experience plugins to improve usability would also be useful. 
Something like a VS Code extension}.

\section{Many more artifacts/more document knowledge}

Journal papers, Jupyter notebooks, lesson plans, etc.

\section{More display variabilities}

\section{More languages (?)}

\section{More scientific knowledge}

Med, Chem, etc.

\section{More computational knowledge}

Higher order ODEs, linear system solvers, external libs, etc.

\ds{More software engineering/process knowledge}

\section{Measuring Drasil's Effectiveness}

We have made many observations as to how we believe Drasil can improve the 
lives of developers (Chapter~\ref{c:results}), however, we have not yet backed 
that up with hard data. We need to design several experiments with differing 
goals to test Drasil's effectiveness in improving developer quality of life. 
Here we propose several experiments:

\begin{itemize}
\item Test the difficulty of create net new software in Drasil vs traditional 
methods
\item Test the difficulty of finding and removing inconsistencies/errors using 
Drasil vs traditional methods
\item Comparing costs (incl. developer time) of maintenance using Drasil vs 
traditional methods
\end{itemize}

\ds{More TBD?}

\ds{Might want to rephrase the above into ``We want to create a research 
program to answer the following questions" and then list out the questions we 
want to answer, namely ``Is it easier to create software when using Drasil?", 
``Is it easier to find and correct errors when using Drasil?", and ``Are there 
significant time savings in long-term maintenance when using Drasil?"}
