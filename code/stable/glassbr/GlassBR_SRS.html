<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
Software is helpful to efficiently and correctly predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab. The blast under consideration is any kind of man-made explosion. The software, herein called GlassBR aims to predict the blast risk involved with the glass slab using an intuitive interface.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for GlassBR. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the organization of the document, and the characteristics of the intended reader.
</p>
<a id="Sec:DocPurpose">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Purpose of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The main purpose of this document is to predict whether a given glass slab is likely to resist a specified blast. The goals and theoretical models used in the GlassBR code are provided, with an emphasis on explicitly identifying assumptions and unambiguous definitions. This document is intended to be used as a reference to provide all information necessary to understand and verify the analysis. The SRS is abstract because the contents say what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to &quot;fake&quot; a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:ReqsScope">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Scope of Requirements
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements includes getting all input parameters related to the glass slab and also the parameters related to blast type. Given the appropriate inputs, the code for GlassBR is intended to use the data and predict whether the glass slab is safe to use or not.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:ReaderChars">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Characteristics of Intended Reader
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
Reviewers of this documentation should have a strong knowledge in theory behind glass breakage and blast risk. The reviewers should also have an understanding of second year calculus, structural mechanics, and computer applications in civil engineering.In addition, reviewers should be familiar with the applicable standards for constructions using glass from [4-6] in <a href=#Sec:References>References</a>. The users of GlassBR can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in <a href=#Sec:UserChars>User Characteristics</a>.

<h3>
Organization of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a> and <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a>, with some aspects taken from Volere template 16 <a href=#rbrtsn2012>rbrtsn2012</a>. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the data definitions in <a href=#Sec:DDs>Data Definitions</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The data definitions are used to support the definitions of the different models.

<h3>
Individual Product Use Cases
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The user provides the inputs to GlassBR for use within the analysis. There are two main classes of inputs: glass geometry and blast type. The glass geometry based inputs include the glass type and dimensions of the glass plane. The blast type input includes parameters like weight of charge, TNT equivalent factor and stand off distance from the point of explosion. These parameters describe charge weight and stand off blast. Another input the user gives is the tolerable value of probability of breakage. GlassBR outputs if the glass slab will be safe by comparing whether capacity is greater than demand. Capacity is the the load resistance calculated and demand is the requirement which is the 3 second duration equivalent pressure. The second condition is to check whether the calculated probability (<em>P<sub>b</sub></em>) is less than the tolerable probability (<em>P<sub>btol</sub></em>) which is obtained from the user as an input. If both conditions return true then it's shown that the glass slab is safe to use, else if both return false then the glass slab is considered unsafe. All the supporting calculated values are also displayed as output.

Non-Functional Requirements
</h3>

This problem is small in size and relatively simple, so performance is not a priority. Any reasonable implementation will be very quick and use minimal storage. Rather than performance, the non-functional requirement priorities are correctness, verifiability, understandability, reusability, maintainability, and portability.
