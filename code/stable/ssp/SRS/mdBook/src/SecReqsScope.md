# Scope of Requirements {#Sec:ReqsScope}

The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) soil mass, composed of a single homogeneous layer with constant material properties. The soil mass is assumed to extend infinitely in the third dimension. The analysis will be at an instant in time; factors that may change the soil properties over time will not be considered.
