Physical System Description

Elements:
	1) The object.

Goal Statments
1) Check if the final position from user input is reached by the object with initial conditions.

2) If the final position is not reached, provide the offset and if the object went long or short.

Theoretical Models

General Definitions
1) v_x = v*cos(θ)
2) v_y = v*sin(θ)
3) v_f = v_i + a*t
4) d = v_i_x*t + a_x*(t^2)/2

Data Definitions
1) v - input
2) θ - input
3) d_aim - input
4) d = 2*(v_i^2)*sin(θ)*cos(θ)/(|a|) - output (from A3, IM1)

Instance Models
1) 0 = v_i_y + a*t/2 (from GD3) - v at max height = 0
                                - t at max height = t_total/2
