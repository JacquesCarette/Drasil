<h1>
Introduction
</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in signifcant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program (SSP). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
</p>
<div id="Sec:DocPurpose">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Purpose of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of SSP and the models that will be used to meet those requirements. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SSP. With the exception of system constraints in <a href=#Sec:SysConstraints>Section: System Constraints</a>, this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a>, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to &quot;fake&quot; a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Sec:ReqsScope">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Scope of Requirements
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) soil mass, composed of a single homogeneous layer with constant material properties. The soil mass is assumed to extend infinitely in the third dimension. The analysis will be at an instant in time; factors that may change the soil properties over time will not be considered.
</p>

<div id="Sec:ReaderChars">

<h2>
Characteristics of Intended Reader
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate level 4 physics and undergraduate level 2 or higher solid mechanics. It would be an asset to understand soil mechanics. The users of SSP can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in <a href=#Sec:UserChars>Section: User Characteristics</a>.

<h2>
Organization of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a> as well as Smith and Lai <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a>. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in <a href=#Sec:IMs>Section: Instance Models</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements (<a href=#Sec:GoalStmt>Section: Goal Statements</a>) are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models (<a href=#Sec:TMs>Section: Theoretical Models</a>) to the instance models (<a href=#Sec:IMs>Section: Instance Models</a>). The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved.

<h3>
Terminology and Definitions
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.
</p>
<div class="list">
<p>
Factor of Safety: The global stability metric of a slip surface of a slope, defined as the ratio of resistive shear force to mobilized shear force
</p>
<p>
Slip Surface: A surface within a slope that has the potential to fail or displace due to load or other forces.
</p>
<p>
Critical Slip Surface: Slip surface of the slope that has the lowest factor of safety, and is therefore most likely to experience failure.
</p>
<p>
Water Table: The upper boundary of a saturated zone in the ground.
</p>
<p>
Stress: Forces that are exerted between planes internal to a larger body subject to external loading.
</p>
<p>
Strain: A measure of deformation of a body or plane under stress.
</p>
<p>
Normal Force: A force applied perpendicular to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Shear Force: A force applied parallel to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Mobilized Shear Force: Shear force in the direction of potential motion, thus encouraging motion along the plane.
</p>
<p>
Resistive Shear Force: Shear force in the direction opposite to the direction of potential motion, thus hindering motion along the plane.
</p>
<p>
Effective Forces and Stresses: The normal force or normal stress carried by the soil skeleton. The total normal force or normal stress is composed of the effective force or stress and the force or stress exerted by water.

Cohesion: An attractive force between adjacent particles that holds the matter together.

<p>
Isotropy: A condition where the value of a property is independent of the direction in which it is measured.
</p>
<p>
Plane Strain: A condition where the resultant stresses in one of the directions of a  three-dimensional material can be approximated as zero. This condition results when a body is constrained to not deform in one direction, or when the length of one dimension of the body dominates the others, to the point where it can be assumed as infinite. Stresses in the direction of the dominant dimension can be approximated as zero.

<p class="paragraph">
The multiplication of the <em>Ψ</em> terms can be further distributed over the subtractions, resulting in the equation having terms that each either contain an <em>R</em> or a <em>T</em>. The equation can then be rearranged so terms containing an <em>R</em> are on one side of the equality, and terms containing a <em>T</em> are on the other. The multiplication by the factor of safety is common to all of the <em>T</em> terms, and thus can be factored out, resulting in:

<p class="paragraph">
<a href=#Table:InDataConstraints>Table:InDataConstraints</a> and <a href=#Table:OutDataConstraints>Table:OutDataConstraints</a> show the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.
