# Terminology and Definitions {#Sec:TermDefs}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.

- Gravity: The force that attracts one physical body with mass to another.
- Cartesian coordinate system: A coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length (from [cartesianWiki](./SecReferences.md#cartesianWiki)).
- Multivector: A generalization of scalars, vectors, and higher-grade elements in Clifford algebra that can represent rotations and reflections.
- Clifford algebra: A unification of real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and several other hypercomplex number systems into a single mathematical framework.
- Geometric product: The fundamental operation in Clifford algebra that combines the dot product and wedge product of vectors.
- Basis vector: Fundamental unit vectors (e₁, e₂) that span the 2D Clifford space and satisfy the relations e₁² = e₂² = 1.
- Clifford space: The geometric algebra space Cl(2,0) where multivectors exist, characterized by basis vectors e₁, e₂ with signature (+,+).
- Bivector: A grade-2 multivector element e₁∧e₂ representing oriented area and rotations in the plane.
