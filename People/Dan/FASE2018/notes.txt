Lenses  
  - Neat, but are we really using them to their potential?
  
Context(s) 
  - SymbolMap, etc. and the assoc classes (we can see from the context
  whether a symboltable,...,etc. exists). Maps ids to requisite fields
  
Generator enforces symboltable
  - no using uncaptured (undefined?) symbs

Chunks - duh
  - Really get into details?
    - What do we consider NI, CI, CC, etc.?
  - Mix and match classes to create more meaningful chunks 
    (ConstrConcept = Conceptual Quantities)

Gool Integration
  - Multi-lang code generation

Document.hs
  - Data type for intermediate-stage document bodies

DocumentLanguage.hs
  - Language of document(s). A "little" language for writing 
    artifacts which abstracts away commonalities.

Referencing
  - Auto-gen of refs; LayoutObj class with refName/rType

Expression language - duh
  - Needs to be Typed.

NounPhrases and their associated functions (including those in Misc) 
  - for handling some English language stuff?

People 
  - ? Is changing conventions interesting?
  
Recipe 
  - Kind of redundant at this point, needs an upgrade
  
Spaces 
  - Current and future - Discrete vs. Continuous
  
Sentence
  - Intermediate repr - How we mix all these different types of information
Symbol
  - default ordering, combinations: X vs. X_min vs. X_max (All relate to X
    and built from it -> if X changes, the others auto change)?

SystemInfo 
  - Mashup of most (all? not yet) requisite chunks

Language of Units
  - For building units; Derive from fundamental SI
  
Equations / QDefinitions
  - Quantities with a defining equation (ie. of the form x = some expression)
  
ExprRelat
  - Should be removed if not in use.
  
LCChunk / ReqChunk
  - Doubt its usefulness
