--------------------------------------------------

This folder contains our working examples (implementations in Drasil of the previously manually created case studies).

**dblpend**
  - Contains the current state of the Double Pendulum case study implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [dblpend](https://github.com/Zhang-Zhi-ZZ/CAS741Project/tree/master/Double%20Pendulum) Double Pendulum example.

**gamephysics**
  - Contains the current state of the Game Physics case study implemented in Drasil

    in the [gamephysics](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/master/CaseStudies/gamephys) 2D Rigid Body Physics Library.

**glassbr**
  - Contains the current state of the GlassBR case study implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [Glass-BR](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/master/CaseStudies/glass) example.
  
**hghc**
  - Contains the current state of the HGHC (fuel pin) example implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [hghc](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/master/CaseStudies/hghc) toy example.
  
**swhsnopcm**
  - Contains the current state of the solar water heating system case study implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [Nopcm](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/master/CaseStudies/noPCM) SWHS without PCM example.

**pdcontroller**
  - Contains the current state of the PD Controller example implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [Proportional Derivative Controller](https://github.com/muralidn/CAS741-Fall20/tree/master) example.

**projectile**

**ssp**
  - Contains the current state of the slope stability analysis case study implemented in Drasil
  - This is a re-creation of the original, manually-created version 
    in the [SSP](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/blob/master/CaseStudies/ssp) Slope Stability Analysis example. 
  
**swhs**
  - Contains the current state of the solar water heating system incorporating phase change material case study implemented in Drasil
