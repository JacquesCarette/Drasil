Generative Programming from a DSL Viewpoint - Charles Consel
------------------------------------------------------------

- Mentions cross-cutting concerns and DSL general use cases. Good for bg

------------------------------------------------------------
Generative Programming from an AOP/CBSE Perspective - Mira Mezini & Klaus Ostermann
------------------------------------------------------------

- Has great citations
- Focused on AOP, but some interesting comments on decomposition and model-relations
  specifically re: cross-cutting concerns and model projections
- "Software decomposition techniques so far including OO decomp are weak at
  supporting multi-view decomposition"
- Gets into formal definitions of model projections
- Pro AOP and GPLs, anti-DSL

Overview of Generative Software Development - Krzysztof Czarnecki
------------------------------------------------------------

- Lots of great stuff - advocates shifting to software family generation
- Good references to check out
- "Domain engineering supplies application engineering with the reusable assets
  whereas application engineering feeds back new requirements to domain engineering"
  - Correlates well to our interation & refinement work, since it was iterating
    on applications by refining the domain and vice versa.  
- "Domain engineering can be applied at different levels of maturity... establish
  a common terminology among different... teams... introduce a common architecture
  for a set of systems... provide a set of components...the assembly of these
  components can be partially or fully automated using generators and/or
  configurators... the generated products may also contain non-software artifacts,
  such as test plans, manuals, tutorials, maintenance guidelines, etc."
  - I'd argue those are all non-code software artifacts, not non-software artifacts.
- What's the Draco model of domains and software generation? (TODO: Read the paper)
- Lots of discussion on DSLs and existing generative tech
- MDD primer - "aims at capturing every important aspect of a software system 
  through appropriate models"
