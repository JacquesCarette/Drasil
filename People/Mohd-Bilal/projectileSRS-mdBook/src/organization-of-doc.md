# Organization of Document

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [koothoor2013](./references.md#koothoor2013), [smithLai2005](./references.md#smithLai2005), [smithEtAl2007](./references.md#smithEtAl2007), and [smithKoothoor2016](./references.md#smithKoothoor2016). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](./instance-models.md) and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The [goal statements](./goal-statements.md) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](./theoretical-models.md) to the [instance models](./instance-models.md).
