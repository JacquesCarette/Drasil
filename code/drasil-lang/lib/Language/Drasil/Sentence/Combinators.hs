-- | Defines various sentence level combinators that may be based in English and
-- not necessarily have a conceptual link. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/wiki/Combinator-Documentation)
-- for more information. There are also @C@ variants to each combinator to
-- denote those meant for use at the start of a sentence (capitalizes the first word).
-- This module should be used as a qualified import (usually as @S@),
-- as many function names clash with those in Concepts.hs and NounPhrase.hs.
