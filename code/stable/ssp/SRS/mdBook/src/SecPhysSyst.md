# Physical System Description {#Sec:PhysSyst}

The physical system of SSP, as shown in [Fig:PhysicalSystem](./SecPhysSyst.md#Figure:PhysicalSystem), includes the following elements:

PS1: A slope comprised of one soil layer.

PS2: A water table, which may or may not exist.

Morgenstern-Price analysis [morgenstern1965](./SecReferences.md#morgenstern1965) of the slope involves representing the slope as a series of vertical slices. As shown in [Fig:IndexConvention](./SecPhysSyst.md#Figure:IndexConvention), the index \\(i\\) is used to denote a value for a single slice, and an interslice value at a given index \\(i\\) refers to the value between slice \\(i\\) and adjacent slice \\(i+1\\).

A free body diagram of the forces acting on a slice is displayed in [Fig:ForceDiagram](./SecPhysSyst.md#Figure:ForceDiagram). The specific forces and symbols will be discussed in detail in [Sec:General Definitions](./SecGDs.md#Sec:GDs) and [Sec:Data Definitions](./SecDDs.md#Sec:DDs).
