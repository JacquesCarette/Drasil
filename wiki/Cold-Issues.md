These are issues we would like to return to. We aren't ready to talk about them now, but they contain insights that we want to track.

- Emphasis in text, likely for definitions: [#12](../issues/12) (and comments therein)
- Generation code for integration/summation [#72](../issues/72).
- Addition of friction and collisions to Game physics engine: [#298](../issues/298)
- Formatting options of lists: see side discussion in [#327](../issues/327)
- When we get back to code generation, esp. for SSP and GamePhys, some features are missing [#372](../issues/372)
- Add a Design Document [#417](../issues/417); should probably also use Grounded Theory do to it? [#430](../issues/430)
- Adding the option to use other documentation-tools, besides Doxygen, such as Javadoc, in generated code [#1794](../issues/1794)
