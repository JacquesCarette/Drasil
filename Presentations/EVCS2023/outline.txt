Context (of the presentation):
- Eelco Visser Commemorative Symposium (to tie in to his work!)
- just 10 minutes, so
  - make it memorable
  - make it a sales pitch
- extra twist: diverse audience. Make it understandable to them too!

Outline
1. Title
2. "Old Fashioned" -- presented as a quote?
3. well understood (as a key driver) 
   equations; "well understood"
4. knowledge duplication; redundancy illustration
    Spencer's nice picture
   emergence of "language of design"
5. the process "pictorially"
  - (human-provided) knowledge -> programmer's brains -> softifacts
  - knowledge + (hp) design -> program -> softifacts
6. documentation / English as our key difference
    (github AI project?)
7. better tech (Haskell, DSLs, GOOL, codegen, tagless, ?)
   and better theory
8. What if we wrote a program to output what 'we' usually do by hand?
  One potential 'answer': Drasil
