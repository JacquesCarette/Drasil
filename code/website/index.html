  Drasil is a framework for generating all of the software artifacts from a stable knowledge base,
  focusing currently on scientific software. The main goals are to reduce knowledge duplication and
  improve traceability. The atifacts are generated from a common knowledge-base using recipes
  written in a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). These recipes allow us to specify which pieces of
  knowledge should be used in which artifacts, how to transform them, and more.

  This webpage is designed to contain the most up to date
  <a href="#caseStudies">case study artifacts</a>,
  $if(docsUrl)$ <a href="#haskDoc">Haddock documentation</a>, $endif$
  and <a href="#packages">package dependency graphs</a> from the Drasil repository.
  The case study artifacts include the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the case study,
  which specifies what the program sets out to achieve.
  The Haddock Documentation section contains the current documentation for the Drasil framework.
  The package dependency graphs shows the hierarchy of modules within each package.
  The footer of this page contains the continuous integration build of the project,
  as well as the commit number that the build and artifacts are based off of.
