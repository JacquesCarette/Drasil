-- | Generalized traceability graph introduction: appends references to the

--   related ideas, it makes them an edge.
makeTGraph :: [UID] -> [[UID]] -> [UID] -> [(UID, [UID])]

-- | Checker for uids by finding if the <a>UID</a> is in one of the
--   possible data sets contained in the <a>System</a> database.

--   we use this to get a list of <a>UID</a>s for a traceability graph
--   instead.
traceGHeader :: (ChunkDB -> [UID]) -> System -> [UID]

-- | Helper that finds the headers of the traceability matrix rows.
--   However, here we use this to get a list of <a>UID</a>s for a

--   edges.
traceGRowHeader :: ([UID] -> [UID]) -> System -> [UID]

-- | Helper that makes references of the form "<tt>reference</tt> shows the
--   dependencies of <tt>something</tt>". Only takes a reference <a>UID</a>
