# System Context {#Sec:SysContext}

[Fig:sysCtxDiag](./SecSysContext.md#Figure:sysCtxDiag) shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SSP). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.

The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

- User Responsibilities
  - Provide the input data related to the soil layer(s) and water table (if applicable), ensuring conformation to input data format required by SSP
  - Ensure that consistent units are used for input variables
  - Ensure required [software assumptions](./SecAssumps.md#Sec:Assumps) are appropriate for the problem to which the user is applying the software
- SSP Responsibilities
  - Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters input instead of a floating point number
  - Verify that the inputs satisfy the required physical and other [data constraints](./SecDataConstraints.md#Sec:DataConstraints)
  - Identify the critical slip surface within the possible input range
  - Find the factor of safety for the slope
  - Find the interslice normal force and shear force along the critical slip surface
