-- The misnomers below are not actually a bad thing, we want to ensure data can't
-- be added to a map if it's not coming from a chunk, and there's no point confusing

-- what they state.
type UMap a = Map.Map UID (a, Int)

-- | A bit of a misnomer as it's really a map of all quantities, for retrieving
-- symbols and their units.
type SymbolMap  = UMap QuantityDict

-- | A map of all concepts, normally used for retrieving definitions.
type ConceptMap = UMap ConceptChunk

-- | A map of all the units used. Should be restricted to base units/synonyms.
type UnitMap = UMap UnitDefn

-- | Again a bit of a misnomer as it's really a map of all NamedIdeas.
-- Until these are built through automated means, there will
-- likely be some 'manual' duplication of terms as this map will contain all
-- quantities, concepts, etc.
