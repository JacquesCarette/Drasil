-- | A node family contains a list of <a>UID</a>s, their display labels,
--   general subgraph label, and colour.
data NodeFamily
NF :: [UID] -> [Label] -> Label -> Colour -> NodeFamily

-- | Node <a>UID</a>s.
[nodeUIDs] :: NodeFamily -> [UID]

-- | Display labels for nodes. We use the reference addresses from the
