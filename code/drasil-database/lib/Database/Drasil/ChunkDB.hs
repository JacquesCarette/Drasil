-- | The misnomers below (for the following Map types) are not actually a bad thing. We want to ensure data can't
-- be added to a map if it's not coming from a chunk, and there's no point confusing
-- what the map is for. One is for symbols + their units, and the others are for
-- what they state.
type UMap a = Map.Map UID (a, Int)

-- | A bit of a misnomer as it's really a map of all quantities, for retrieving
-- symbols and their units.
type SymbolMap  = UMap QuantityDict

-- | A map of all concepts, normally used for retrieving definitions.
type ConceptMap = UMap ConceptChunk

-- | A map of all the units used. Should be restricted to base units/synonyms.
type UnitMap = UMap UnitDefn

-- | Again a bit of a misnomer as it's really a map of all 'NamedIdea's.
-- Until these are built through automated means, there will
-- likely be some 'manual' duplication of terms as this map will contain all
-- quantities, concepts, etc.
type TermMap = UMap IdeaDict
-- | A traceability map, used to hold the relation between one 'UID' and a list of other 'UID's.

-- | Data definitions map. Contains all data definitions ('DataDefinition').
type DatadefnMap = UMap DataDefinition
-- | Instance model map. Contains all instance models ('InstanceModel').

-- | General definitions map. Contains all general definitions ('GenDefn').
type GendefMap = UMap GenDefn
-- | Theory model map. Contains all theoretical models ('TheoryModel').

-- | Concept instance map. May hold similar information to a 'ConceptMap', but may also be referred to.

-- | A map of all 'LabelledContent's.
