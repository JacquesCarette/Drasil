    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in significant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program (SSP). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Slope Stability analysis Program. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SSP. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) soil mass, composed of a single homogeneous layer with constant material properties. The soil mass is assumed to extend infinitely in the third dimension. The analysis will be at an instant in time; factors that may change the soil properties over time will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate level 4 physics and undergraduate level 2 or higher solid mechanics. It would be an asset to understand soil mechanics. The users of SSP can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a>  as well as Smith and Lai <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs). The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved.\n",

    "$$M={F_{\\text{rot}}} r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_rot$ is the force causing rotation and $r$ is the length of the moment arm, or the distance between the force and the axis about which the rotation acts. To represent the moment equilibrium, the moments from each force acting on a slice must be considered and added together. The forces acting on a slice are all shown in [Fig:ForceDiagram](#Figure:ForceDiagram). The midpoint of the base of a slice is considered as the axis of rotation, from which the length of the moment arm is measured. Considering first the interslice normal force acting on slice interface $i$, the moment is negative because the force tends to rotate the slice in a counterclockwise direction, and the length of the moment arm is the height of the force plus the difference in height between the base at slice interface $i$ and the base at the midpoint of slice $i$.

    "Next, the interslice normal water force is considered. This force is zero at the height of the water table, then increases linearly towards the base of the slice due to the increasing water pressure. For such a triangular distribution, the resultant force acts at one-third of the height. Thus, for the interslice normal water force acting on slice interface $i$, the moment is:\n",
    "$$-{\\symbf{H}}_{i} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} {\\symbf{h}_{\\text{z,w},i}}+\\frac{{\\symbf{b}}_{i}}{2} \\tan\\left({\\symbf{α}}_{i}\\right)\\right)$$\n",

The corresponding length of the moment arm is $y$, the height from the base of the slice to the segment under consideration. In reality, the forces near the surface of the soil mass are slightly different due to the slope of the surface, but this difference is assumed to be negligible ([A:Negligible-Effect-Surface-Slope-Seismic](#assumpNESSS)). The resultant moment from the forces on all of the segments with an equivalent resultant length of the moment arm is determined by taking the integral over the slice height. The forces tend to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, so the moment is negative:\n",
