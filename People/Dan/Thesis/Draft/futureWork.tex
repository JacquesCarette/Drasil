\chapter{Future Work}
\ds{This can probably be a section at the end of results / conclusion instead?}

Development of Drasil is ongoing and the framework is still being iterated upon
to date. In this section we present areas we believe have room for improvement
along with plans for additional features to be added in the long-term.

\section{Typed Expression Language}

\section{Model types}
\section{Usability}
As mentioned in the results section, usability remains a great area for
improvement for Drasil. Work to create a visual front-end for the framework
has been planned and we hope to eventually get to the point of usability being
as simple as drag-and-drop or similar mechanisms.

Work on usability will address each of the core areas of development with
Drasil: knowledge-capture of system-agnostic information,
knowledge-capture of system-specific information, and recipe creation and
modification.
