# Goal Statements {#Sec:GoalStmt}

Given the shape of the soil mass, the location of the water table, and the material properties of the soil, the goal statements are:

<div id="identifyCritAndFS"></div>

Identify-Crit-and-FS: Identify the critical slip surface and the corresponding factor of safety.

<div id="determineNormalF"></div>

Determine-Normal-Forces: Determine the interslice normal forces between each pair of vertical slices of the slope.

<div id="determineShearF"></div>

Determine-Shear-Forces: Determine the interslice shear forces between each pair of vertical slices of the slope.
