-- | Defines output formats for the different documents we can generate.
module Language.Drasil.Output.Formats

-- | When choosing your document, you must specify the filename for the
--   generated output (specified <i>without</i> a file extension).
type Filename = String

-- | Document types include Software Requirements Specification and
--   Website. Choosing SRS will generate both TeX and HTML files, while
--   Website generates only as HTML. This also determines what folders the
--   generated files will be placed into.
data DocType
SRS :: DocType
Website :: DocType

-- | Document choices include the type of document as well as the file
--   formats we want to generate as.

[doctype] :: DocChoices -> DocType
[format] :: DocChoices -> [Format]

-- | Document specifications. Holds the type of document (<a>DocType</a>)
--   and its name (<a>Filename</a>).
