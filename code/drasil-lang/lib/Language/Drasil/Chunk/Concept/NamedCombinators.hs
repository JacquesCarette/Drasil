-- | Defines various chunk combinators. The full naming scheme can be found
-- in the [Wiki](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/wiki/Combinator-Documentation).
-- For convenience, here is a summary:
--
--    * Combinators that conflict with haskell-native functions have an underscore appended.
--    * Default pluralNP case for combinators will be first term singular, second term plural.
--    * @P@ and @S@ denote the pluralNP case of the combinator when it does not follow the above default.
--    * @Gen@ denotes the general function case.
--    * Although this should eventually be phased out, @T@ denotes a combinator meant for use with titles.
--    * @NI@ and @NP@ denote whether something must be a part of the 'NamedIdea' or 'NounPhrase' class.
