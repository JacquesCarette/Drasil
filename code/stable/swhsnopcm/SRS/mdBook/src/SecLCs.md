<div id="likeChgTCVOD"></div>

Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Day: [A:Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Time](./SecAssumps.md#assumpTHCCoT) - The temperature of the heating coil will change over the course of the day, depending on the energy received from the sun.

<div id="likeChgTCVOL"></div>

Temperature-Coil-Variable-Over-Length: [A:Temp-Heating-Coil-Constant-over-Length](./SecAssumps.md#assumpTHCCoL) - The temperature of the heating coil will actually change along its length as the water within it cools.

<div id="likeChgDT"></div>

Discharging-Tank: [A:Charging-Tank-No-Temp-Discharge](./SecAssumps.md#assumpCTNTD) - The model currently only accounts for charging of the tank. That is, increasing the temperature of the water to match the temperature of the coil. A more complete model would also account for discharging of the tank.

<div id="likeChgTLH"></div>

Tank-Lose-Heat: [A:Perfect-Insulation-Tank](./SecAssumps.md#assumpPIT) - Any real tank cannot be perfectly insulated and will lose heat.
