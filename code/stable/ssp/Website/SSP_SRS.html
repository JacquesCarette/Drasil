<h1>
Introduction
</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock and sometimes water, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. This can cause instability in the form of soil or rock movement. The effects of soil or rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in signifcant life and economic losses. Slope stability is of interest both when analysing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of its relative stability known as the factor of safety.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability analysis Program (SSP). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
</p>
<div id="Sec:DocPurpose">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Purpose of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of SSP and the models that will be used to meet those requirements. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SSP. With the exception of system constraints in <a href=#Sec:SysConstraints>Section: System Constraints</a>, this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a>, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to &quot;fake&quot; a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Sec:ReqsScope">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Scope of Requirements
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements includes stability analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) soil mass, composed of a single homogeneous layer with constant material properties. The soil mass is assumed to extend infinitely in the third dimension. The analysis will be at an instant in time; factors that may change the soil properties over time will not be considered.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Sec:ReaderChars">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Characteristics of Intended Reader
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate level 4 physics and undergraduate level 2 or higher solid mechanics. An understanding of soil mechanics would be an asset. The users of SSA can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in <a href=#Sec:UserChars>Section: User Characteristics</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Sec:DocOrg">
<div class="subsection">
<h2>
Organization of Document
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor as well as Smith and Lai. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in <a href=#Sec:IMs>Section: Instance Models</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved iteratively to perform a Morgenstern Price Analysis.

Problem Description
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
SSA is a computer program developed to evaluate the factor of safety of a slope's slip surface and identify the critical slip surface of the slope, as well as the interslice normal force and shear force along the critical slip surface. It is intended to be used as an educational tool for introducing slope stability issues, and to facilitate the analysis and design of a safe slope.

Terminology and Definitions
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.
</p>
<div class="list">
<p>
Factor of Safety: The global stability of a surface in a slope
</p>
<p>
Critical Slip Surface: Slip surface of the slope that has the lowest global factor of safety, and therefore most likely to experience failure.
</p>
<p>
Stress: Forces that are exerted between planes internal to a larger body subject to external loading.
</p>
<p>
Strain: Stress forces that result in deformation of the body/plane.
</p>
<p>
Normal Force: A force applied perpendicular to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Shear Force: A force applied parallel to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Plane Strain: The resultant stresses in one of the directions of a 3 dimensional material can be approximated as 0. Results when the length of one dimension of the body dominates the others. Stresses in the dominant dimensions direction are the ones that can be approximated as 0.

Physical System Description

Analysis of the slope is performed by looking at properties of the slope as a series of slice elements. Some properties are interslice properties, and some are slice or slice base properties.

For a soil under stress it will exert a shear resistive strength based on the Coulomb sliding law. The resistive shear is the maximum amount of shear a surface can experience while remaining rigid, analogous to a maximum normal force. In this model the resistive shear stress <em>τ</em> is proportional to the product of the normal stress on the plane <em>σ</em> with it's static friction in the angular form <em>tan(φ&prime;) = U<sub>t</sub></em>. The <em>τ</em> versus <em>σ</em> relationship is not truly linear, but assuming the effective normal force is strong enough, it can be approximated with a linear fit (<a href=#A:Surface-Base-Slice-between-Interslice-Straight-Lines>A: Surface-Base-Slice-between-Interslice-Straight-Lines</a>) where the cohesion <em>c&prime;</em> represents the <em>τ</em> intercept of the fitted line.

<p class="paragraph">
The multiplication of the <em>Ψ</em> terms can be further distributed over the subtractins, resulting in the equation having terms that each either contain an <em>R</em> or a <em>T</em>. The equation can then be rearranged so terms containing an <em>R</em> are on one side of the equality, and terms containing a <em>T</em> are on the other. The multiplication by the factor of safety is common to all of the <em>T</em> terms, and thus can be factored out, resulting in:

<a href=#Table:InDataConstraints>Table:InDataConstraints</a> and <a href=#Table:OutDataConstraints>Table:OutDataConstraints</a> show the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.
