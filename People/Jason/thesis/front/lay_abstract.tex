Drasil is a framework for generating software artifacts, such as code and
documentation, that has great potential for improving software quality. Drasil
focuses on generating \ACF{scs} from a \ACF{srs} template where it has been
shown to improve software traceability, verifiability, and reproducibility, and
knowledge reusability. However, Drasil faces issues with using inputted
scientific theories for code generation, handling invalid mathematical
expressions, and carrying all the different types of data we want to input into
it. This work focuses on 4 areas in Drasil to help it realize its full
potential: (1) making theories more usable for code generation by defining their
structure, (2) splitting up the expression language so that we can restrict
terms to specific contexts (such as code, computation, and general discussion),
(3) create a system of type rules and automatically check certain expressions
against them, and (4) unlock Drasil's database to store all kinds of data.
