    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the rising cost of developing video games, developers are looking for ways to save time and money for their projects. Using an open source physics library that is reliable and free will cut down development costs and lead to better quality products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Game Physics. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the game physics library. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of Game Physics. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes the physical simulation of 2D rigid bodies acted on by forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of rigid body dynamics and high school calculus. The users of Game Physics can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a> , <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> , <a href=#smithEtAl2007>smithEtAl2007</a> , and <a href=#smithKoothoor2016>smithKoothoor2016</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",

    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs).\n",

    "## System Context\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:SysContext\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fig:sysCtxDiag](#Figure:sysCtxDiag) shows the system context. A circle represents an entity external to the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (Game Physics). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The interaction between the product and the user is through an application programming interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Responsibilities\n",
    " - Provide initial conditions of the physical state of the simulation, rigid bodies present, and forces applied to them.\n",
    " - Ensure application programming interface use complies with the user guide.\n",
    " - Ensure required [software assumptions](#Sec:Assumps) are appropriate for any particular problem the software addresses.\n",
    "- Game Physics Responsibilities\n",
    " - Determine if the inputs and simulation state satisfy the required [physical and system constraints](#Sec:DataConstraints).\n",
    " - Calculate the new state of all rigid bodies within the simulation at each simulation step.\n",
    " - Provide updated physical state of all rigid bodies at the end of a simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Characteristics\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:UserChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",

    "# Specific System Description\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:SpecSystDesc\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ProbDesc\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A system is needed to create a simple, lightweight, fast, and portable 2D rigid body physics library, which will allow for more accessible game development and the production of higher quality products. Creating a gaming physics library is a difficult task. Games need physics libraries that simulate objects acting under various physical conditions, while simultaneously being fast and efficient enough to work in soft real-time during the game. Developing a physics library from scratch takes a long period of time and is very costly, presenting barriers of entry which make it difficult for game developers to include physics in their products. There are a few free, open source and high quality [physics libraries](#Sec:offShelfSolns) available to be used for consumer products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology and Definitions\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:TermDefs\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rigid body: A solid body in which deformation is neglected.\n",
    "- Elasticity: The ratio of the relative velocities of two colliding objects after and before a collision.\n",
    "- Centre of mass: The mean location of the distribution of mass of the object.\n",
    "- Cartesian coordinate system: A coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length (from <a href=#cartesianWiki>cartesianWiki</a> ).\n",
    "- Right-handed coordinate system: A coordinate system where the positive z-axis comes out of the screen..\n",
    "- line: An interval between two points (from <a href=#lineSource>lineSource</a> ).\n",
    "- point: An exact location, it has no size, only position (from <a href=#pointSource>pointSource</a> ).\n",
    "- damping: An influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing, restricting or preventing its oscillations (from <a href=#dampingSource>dampingSource</a> ).\n",
