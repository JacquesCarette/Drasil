# Introduction {#Sec:Intro}

Due to increasing costs, diminishing availability, and negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, the demand is high for renewable energy sources and energy storage technology. Solar water heating systems incorporating phase change material (PCM) use a renewable energy source and provide a novel way of storing energy. Solar water heating systems incorporating PCM improve over the traditional solar water heating systems because of their smaller size. The smaller size is possible because of the ability of PCM to store thermal energy as latent heat, which allows higher thermal energy storage capacity per unit weight.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for solar water heating systems incorporating PCM. The developed program will be referred to as Solar Water Heating System (SWHS). This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
