\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve the qualities of verifiability, maintainability and reusability.
\item Save money and time when managing change.
\end{itemize}
\item One ``source,'' multiple views
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements, including or excluding derivations.
\item Design
\item Test Cases
\item Build instructions
\item ...
\end{itemize}
\item Advantages
\begin{itemize}
\item Reuse chunks and transformed chunks to avoid duplication.
\item Improve understandability, traceability and reproducibility.
\item Increased flexibility

$h_g$ and $h_c$ are symbols which appear in several locations including:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Literate Programmer's Manual
\item The Software Requirements Specification
\item The Source Code
\end{itemize}

Let's take a look!

Modifying $h_g$ or $h_c$ to reflect changes in requirements is not a simple matter. It involves the following steps (at the very least):
\begin{itemize}
\item Update the definition in the SRS, LPM, and all other documents which reference the symbol
\item Modify the source code to reflect the new requirements
\item Trace all dependencies
\item Modify dependents to accomodate the change
\item Ensure each of the documents is now up to date and consistent
\end{itemize}
