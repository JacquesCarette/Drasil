-- | Re-export database types and functions to simplify external use.
module Database.Drasil

-- | Our chunk databases. Must contain all maps needed in an example. In
--   turn, these maps must contain every chunk definition or concept used
--   in its respective example, else an error is thrown.
data ChunkDB
CDB :: SymbolMap -> TermMap -> ConceptMap -> UnitMap -> TraceMap -> RefbyMap -> DatadefnMap -> InsModelMap -> GendefMap -> TheoryModelMap -> ConceptInstanceMap -> SectionMap -> LabelledContentMap -> ReferenceMap -> ChunkDB

-- | A reference map, used to hold a <a>UID</a> and where it is referenced
--   (<a>UID</a>s).
type RefbyMap = Map UID [UID]

-- | A traceability map, used to hold the relation between one <a>UID</a>
--   and a list of other <a>UID</a>s.
type TraceMap = Map UID [UID]

-- | The misnomers below (for the following Map types) are not actually a
--   bad thing. We want to ensure data can't be added to a map if it's not
--   coming from a chunk, and there's no point confusing what the map is
--   for. One is for symbols + their units, and the others are for what
--   they state.
type UMap a = Map UID (a, Int)

-- | Smart constructor for chunk databases. Takes in the following:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>[<a>Quantity</a>] (for <a>SymbolMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>NamedIdea</a>s (for <a>TermMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>Concept</a>s (for <a>ConceptMap</a>),</li>
--   <li>Units (something that <a>IsUnit</a> for <a>UnitMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>DataDefinition</a>s (for <a>DatadefnMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>InstanceModel</a>s (for <a>InsModelMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>GenDefn</a>s (for <a>GendefMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>TheoryModel</a>s (for <a>TheoryModelMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>ConceptInstance</a>s (for <a>ConceptInstanceMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>Section</a>s (for <a>SectionMap</a>),</li>
--   <li><a>LabelledContent</a>s (for <a>LabelledContentMap</a>).</li>
