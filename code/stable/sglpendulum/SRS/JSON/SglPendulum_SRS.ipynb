    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A pendulum consists of mass attached to the end of a rod and its moving curve is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Therefore, it is useful to have a program to simulate the motion of the pendulum to exhibit its chaotic characteristics. The program documented here is called Pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Pendulum. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Pendulum. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of SglPendulum. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes the analysis of a two-dimensional (2D) pendulum motion problem with various initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of undergraduate level 2 physics, undergraduate level 1 calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The users of SglPendulum can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a>  and <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [goal statements](#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](#Sec:IMs).\n",

    "# General System Description\n",

    "## System Context\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:SysContext\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fig:sysCtxDiag](#Figure:sysCtxDiag) shows the system context. A circle represents an entity external to the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (SglPendulum). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.\n",

    "The interaction between the product and the user is through an application programming interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Responsibilities\n",
    " - Provide initial conditions of the physical state of the motion and the input data related to the Pendulum, ensuring no errors in the data entry.\n",
    " - Ensure that consistent units are used for input variables.\n",
    " - Ensure required [software assumptions](#Sec:Assumps) are appropriate for any particular problem input to the software.\n",
    "- SglPendulum Responsibilities\n",
    " - Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters input instead of a floating point number.\n",
    " - Determine if the inputs satisfy the required physical and software constraints.\n",
    " - Calculate the required outputs.\n",
    " - Generate the required graphs.\n",

    "When the pendulum is displaced to an initial angle and released, the pendulum swings back and forth with periodic motion. By applying [Newton's second law for rotational motion](#TM:NewtonSecLawRotMot), the equation of motion for the pendulum may be obtained:\n",
    "$$\\symbf{τ}=\\symbf{I} α$$\n",

    "The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. The arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a component is changed, the components that it points to should also be changed. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsA](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsA) shows the dependencies of assumptions on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphAvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAvsAll) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. [Fig:TraceGraphRefvsRef](#Figure:TraceGraphRefvsRef) shows the dependencies of data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models with each other. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsR](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsR) shows the dependencies of requirements, goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models. [Fig:TraceGraphAllvsAll](#Figure:TraceGraphAllvsAll) shows the dependencies of dependencies of assumptions, models, definitions, requirements, goals, and changes with each other.\n",
