# Organization of Document {#Sec:DocOrg}

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [koothoor2013](./SecReferences.md#koothoor2013), [smithLai2005](./SecReferences.md#smithLai2005), [smithEtAl2007](./SecReferences.md#smithEtAl2007), and [smithKoothoor2016](./SecReferences.md#smithKoothoor2016). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The [goal statements](./SecGoalStmt.md#Sec:GoalStmt) are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models](./SecTMs.md#Sec:TMs) to the [instance models](./SecIMs.md#Sec:IMs). This document demonstrates a novel approach to modeling the double pendulum using Clifford algebra. The traditional vector-based approach is enhanced by representing physical quantities as multivector in a unified geometric framework. Section 4.2.3 presents general definitions that showcase how velocity, acceleration, and force are naturally expressed using Clifford algebra operations such as the geometric product and basis vector representations..
