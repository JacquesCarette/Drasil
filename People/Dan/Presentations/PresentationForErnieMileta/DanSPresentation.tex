$h_g$ and $h_c$ are symbols which appear in several locations including:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Software Requirements Specification
\item The Literate Programmer's Manual
\item The Source Code
\end{itemize}

Let's take a look!

\begin{equation} 
h_{g} =\frac{2k_{c}h_{p}}{2k_{c}+\tau_c h_{p}}
\end{equation}

The corresponding C code is given by:

\begin{lstlisting}
double 
calc_hg(double k_c,double h_b,double tau_c)
{
 return (2*(k_c)*(h_p)) / 
        ((2*(k_c)) + (tau_c*(h_p)));

Modifying $h_g$ or $h_c$ to reflect changes in requirements is not a simple
matter. It involves, at the very least, the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Update the definition in the SRS, LPM, and all other documents which
  reference the symbol
\item Modify the source code to reflect the new requirements
\item Trace all dependencies
\item Modify dependents to accomodate the change
\item Ensure each of the documents is now up to date and consistent
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Generate a document from our chunks
\item Add options for different document "views"

\item Ex. SRS with or without derivations

\item Add options for additional document types
\item Generate the source code from the equations!
