Style note: I want to thread an example through the entirety of the paper,
  particularly through the KBSE section, as examples would probably drive
  the points home quite a bit better than just walls of text.
  but I'd written most of the outline first, so it needs a bit more work.

[*SS* - I agree with the use of examples.  Figures over text whenever possible is
 also a great idea.]

Title: [*SS* I wonder if a variation on "generate all the things" should be
worked into the title?]

Abstract:

Writing non-executable software artifacts (requirements documents, design,
verification & validation plans, etc.) can be monotonous work, but ultimately
improves the quality of software.
Similarly, maintenance of these artifacts typically requires a large time
investment. Why, in a world of software tools, do we continue to undertake these
efforts manually? Literate programming had the right idea, but focused too
heavily on code.

We present Drasil -- a tool for supporting a Knowledge-Based (KB) approach to
Software Engineering (SE) -- as a means of generating ``all the things".

-- START: Remove from here --
This KB approach aims to reuse as much of the underlying science knowledge
as possible to reduce maintenance woes, while simultaneously allowing
users to update all software artifacts, including code, with the push of a button.
-- END: to here? --

Drasil is still a work in progress being developed through the application of
Grounded Theory. We introduce a series of case studies to exemplify Drasil's
artifact generation and knowledge-reuse mechanics.

As Drasil's knowledge-base continues to grow, creating new software families
in the captured domains will become much easier and faster. We have already seen
how in-built sanity-checking removes a number of tedious, hard-to-notice errors,
not to mention the
-- anecdotally --
effects on how easy it is to maintain documents and trace knowledge between
them.

[*SS* - ideally we will be able to quantify the improvements, at least a little
in the abstract.  Maybe we can do something with counting the generated lines of
documentation?  We will also want to be more specific with the OPG example where
we generate the same documentation following two different recipes.]

=================
Intro
=================
- Blurb on how all artifacts are useful and improve quality. Lead into DDD.

----------------
Doc Driven Des
----------------
- Document-driven design and its advantages/disadvantages.
  - Quality improvements
  - Large time investment for initial artifact creation
  - Large time investment every time something needs to be updated
  - Often artifacts fall out of sync with each other and are inconsistent
  - All but necessary for certification
- Need to overcome the disadvantages somehow.
  - Most obvious solution would be to automate if possible.

----------------
Previous efforts
----------------

[*SS* - I wonder if the previous efforts description should be kept short here,
and we can add a Background section to cover the details?  In general if the
intro is getting too long, which it might, we can put the details in a
background section.  For instance information on grounded theory could go in the
background section.  If we move some of the content elsewhere, we should still
mention the code-centric nature of the previous efforts.]

---- START: move to side note / other subsection? ----
- Compendia
  - Trying to solve the problem of reproducibility **or whichever R goes here**
  - Not focused on DDD or its benefits, moreso focused on good science and
    being able to re-run experiments exactly
-------------- END ------------------------------------

- Previous attempts at automating documentation (à la DDD)
  - LP, tools like javadoc, Haddock, etc.
  - Too code-centric!
  - Comments and code still need to be updated in parallel, albeit to a lesser
    extent in some cases
  - In general, fairly rigidly structured output (you don't have much say on
    how it looks, only what information should be included and, sometimes, where
  - Finish with a focus on the good stuff:
    - Identified the need for good documentation
    - Keeps docs and code in the same place
        - Easier to manually maintain consistency and apply updates
- One other problem we've identified:
  - common underlying knowledge between projects is duplicated as there is no
   real cross-project reuse mechanism in place with these tools.

====================================
Knowledge-Based Software Engineering
====================================

- The main ideas:
  - Capture underlying science knowledge in a meaningful way
  - Reuse wherever appropriate (inter- and intra-project) thanks to
    knowledge-base and transformations.
  - Maintain a single source of knowledge and generate the software artifacts
    from there.
- Scope
  - Well-understood domains
    - There is a solid theoretical underpinning (science/math).
    - We can explain it to a computer! (not as easy as you'd think)
  - Particularly we focus on KBSE for Scientific Computing Software (SCS) as it
    is rich in knowledge

--------------------------
Knowledge vs. Information
--------------------------

- Knowledge is something that can be used and transformed.
  - It is 'alive'
  - It is well-understood (hence transformations).
    -> Points to scope
  - Information is 'dead' -> always appears in the same form
  - Information is not necessarily well-understood.
  - Examples: Knowledge - ConsThermE; Information - this sentence.
- We focus on the capture of knowledge within the database
- We also use information as necessary, since not everything (particularly English
  language sentences) is understood well enough to be transformed.

[*SS* - Is this distinction between knowledge and information your own?  We
don't want to contradict any existing conventions on the use of this
terminology.]

--------------------------
Capturing Knowledge
--------------------------

- Knowledge comes in many forms (theories, concepts, etc.)
  - As such we capture it in a number of chunks
    - Define chunk, use figure to help.
    *F* Chunk Hierarchy (simplified) ***
- Need to capture ALL information around a piece of knowledge, even if it may
  not be relevant to the current phase of development
- Store knowledge in a common knowledge-base for easy inter/intra project reuse
- We are building ontologies, piecewise, for specific domains.
  - But they are useful even when incomplete!

--------------------------
Using Knowledge
--------------------------

- Most obvious benefit -> no more copy/paste! Just reuse the chunk you need.
- Recipes!
  - Represent different 'views' of the knowledge based on how abstract, what
    audience, etc.
    - Transforms the knowledge into its requisite form (eqns, descriptions, code)
    - Variabilities -> Program families.
      - Easy to specialize to different family members
      - Example: SWHS vs NoPCM
      *F* Show portion of each SRS, one similarity, one difference? *F*
- Requires a framework / tool support to automate rendering of recipes

====================================
Heeeeeeeeeere's Drasil
====================================

- To use KBSE to its potential we need a strong support framework
- Intro to Drasil
    *F* Knowledge tree ***
  - What it is and does
    - DSL
    - Generate all the things!
  - How is Knowledge Capture handled in Drasil?
  - What do Recipes look like?
    *F* SmithEtAl template for SRS = Drasil.DocumentLanguage ***
  - Key components of the generator / renderer

---------------------
Grounded Theory
---------------------

- Development following grounded theory (ish).
- Example -> Before SI to today's SI w/ mini-DBs?

[*SS* - should this be in a background section?]

---------------------
Drasil Today
---------------------

- Sentence and Document
- Explain the chunk hierarchy (extended?)
  *F* Chunk hierarchy (extended) ***
- Data.Drasil
  *F* Knowledge areas we've started to capture (See: SE-CSE paper) ***
- Recipe Language(s) -- Refer to:
  *F* Drasil.DocumentLanguage***
- The generator
  - HTML and TeX rendering
  - GOOL for code
- System Information -> Get into it

====================================
The big example(s)
====================================

- Introduce case studies
  - Our methods for reimplementing
  - CI for testing
- Time to show off a bit.
  - Start with common knowledge
  - Then onto GlassBR example to show off the doc lang recipe
  - Then let's see SRS vs. NoPCM for reuse (particularly NoPCM)

---------
Data.Drasil
---------

- Common knowledge
  *F* SI_Units ***
  *F* Thermodynamics (ConsThermE?) ***

--------
GlassBR
--------

- Brief intro to problem GlassBR is solving
- Show off the doc language here
  *F* GlassBR SRS in (truncated) DocLang format ***
  - "Reads like a table of contents, with a few quirks"
- Show off some code generation
  *F* Side-by-side of Chunk Eqn vs. Doc Eqn vs. Code ***
  - "Easy to see that the code matches the equations"
- Talk about potential variabilities and how to make this a family
- Why this example is interesting:
  - ODE solver -> We don't gen, just link to existing good one(s)
  
  [*SS* - The ODE solver is part of SWHS, not GlassBR]

--------
NoPCM & SWHS
--------

- Introduce the problems
- See how they're a family?
- Really drill in the similarities
  *F* Figure showing NoPCM import(s) ***
- Lots of knowledge-reuse
- Very few 'new' chunks (count them?)
- Show example of variability in action
  *F* Equation with/without PCM *** (rendered?)

--------
Others
--------

- Mention SSP, Tiny, GamePhysics, but don't go too in-depth.
  - Useful examples as they give us a wider range of problems
- Testing
  - Physics is physics -> when we make updates, the underlying knowledge isn't
    changing, so neither should our output
  - Refer to CI

--------------------
Compliments of System Information
--------------------
- Thanks to the recipe language and the way we structure out system information
  we can get
- Table of Symbols
- Table of Units
- Table of Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Bibliography

- All tedious to do by hand, but are free to automatically generate
- Generator includes sanity-checking -> Can't use something that isn't defined!

====================================
Results
====================================

--------------------
Common issues across case studies
--------------------
- Auto-generating the symbol table and including sanity-checking revealed a
  number of missing symbols.
- Sanity-checks are run every time artifacts are generated.
- Sanity-checks are 'free' -> we can check for errors with our symbols,
  ensure units are consistent, guard against constraints, and ensure we only
  reference those things which are defined in our system. (see "Compliments ...")

--------------------
NoPCM and SWHS
--------------------
- Along with the common errors, there was some sharing of PCM-related knowledge
  - Found because PCM symbols were not in the ToS and the sanity-check caught it.
  - No way to specifically exclude knowledge that shouldn't 'exist' in a project

-----------------
SSP
-----------------
- Symbols for given quantities changed throughout the documentation
  - Went unnoticed by a human for years! Found almost instantly by Drasil
    - the new symbols were undefined.

-----------------
Error Tracking
-----------------

- Easy to track down errors (smart error messages point to the chunk causing the
  problem).

=====================
Future Work
=====================

[*SS* - Once we are capable of true variability in the documentation, we can
really start asking the question about what is the "best" documentation for a
given context.  In the future experiments could be done with presenting the same
information in different ways to find which approach is the most effective.]

[*SS* - Related to the previous point, the act of formalizing the knowledge that
goes into the requirements documentation forces us to deeply understand the
distinctions between difference concepts, like scope, goal, theory, assumption,
simplification, etc.  With this knowledge we can improve the focus and
effectiveness of existing templates, and existing requirements solicitation and
analysis efforts.  Teaching it to a computer.]
