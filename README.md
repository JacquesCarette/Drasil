The Drasil Framework
====================================================

Generate all the Things!

## What is Drasil?

Drasil is a framework for generating all of the software artifacts from
a stable knowledge base, focusing currently on scientific software. The main goals
are to reduce knowledge duplication and improve traceability. We also are
extreme in our drive to reuse everything.  We hope that
maintainability, verifiability, traceability, and other software qualities will 
also be improved as a side-effect of our methods.

Drasil is used to generate *all* requisite software artifacts from a common 
*knowledge-base* using *recipes* written in a Domain-Specific Language (DSL).
These recipes allow us to specify which pieces of knowledge should be used in
which artifacts, how to transform them, and more.

Drasil is being designed and implemented using a grounded theory approach.  To
determine what is needed and make the design general, we are concurrently
implementing six examples (case studies) in Drasil.  (The specific examples are
listed below under "Building specific examples.")  These examples were first
written using a typical "manual" approach.  The full files for the case studies
are available in [a separate case studies repo](https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies).

For more information on Drasil, please read 
[our position paper](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/master/Dan/ICSE%20Workshop%20-%20SE4Science/ICSE_LiterateFrameworkForSCSoftware_LSS.pdf)
or take a look at 
our [poster](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/blob/master/Dan/CAS%20Poster%20Competition/Poster/DrasilPoster.pdf).

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have [Stack](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#stack) installed (if you have the Haskell Platform, you should already have Stack).
2. Run `stack setup` while in **./code/**
3. Use the `make` command to build the current version of Drasil. This will build and run all of the examples as well.
4. You can find the generated output in the SRS, MIS, MG, C++, and Website folders that appear.

## Building specific examples

Simply run: `make argument` to build the corresponding example, where argument is detailed below:

Argument | Example
-------- | -------
gamephys_diff | Chipmunk2D
swhs_diff | Solar Water Heating System with PCM
glassbr_diff | Glass-BR
tiny_diff | HGHC toy example
ssp_diff | Slope Stability Analysis
nopcm_diff | minimal SWHS example, with PCM removed

## Running the example(s)

After building, you can find the executables for the examples in the relevant subdirectories of .stack-work/dist/ca59d0ab/build/

## Finding / Building the Haddock documentation

You can run `make docs` from the ./code folder to build the documentation.

See the [README](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/tree/master/code#building-up-to-date-documentation) 
in ./code/ for more information.
