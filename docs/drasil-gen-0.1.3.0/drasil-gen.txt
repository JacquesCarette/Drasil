-- | Defines Drasil generator functions.
module Language.Drasil.Generate
dumpTo :: ToJSON a => a -> TargetFile -> IO ()

-- | For debugging purposes, if the system has a <tt>DEBUG_ENV</tt>
--   environment variable set to anything, we can dump the chunk maps in a
--   system to the host system.
dumpEverything :: SystemInformation -> PrintingInformation -> Path -> IO ()
typeCheckSI :: SystemInformation -> IO ()

-- | Generate a number of artifacts based on a list of recipes.
gen :: DocSpec -> Document -> PrintingInformation -> IO ()

-- | Generates traceability graphs as .dot files.
genDot :: SystemInformation -> IO ()

-- | Calls the code generator.
genCode :: Choices -> CodeSpec -> IO ()

-- | Document types include Software Requirements Specification and
--   Website. Choosing SRS will generate both TeX and HTML files, while
--   Website generates only as HTML. This also determines what folders the
--   generated files will be placed into.
data DocType
SRS :: DocType
Website :: DocType
Lesson :: DocType

-- | Document specifications. Holds the type of document (<a>DocType</a>)
--   and its name (<a>Filename</a>).
data DocSpec
DocSpec :: DocChoices -> Filename -> DocSpec

-- | Document choices include the type of document as well as the file
--   formats we want to generate as.
data DocChoices
DC :: DocType -> [Format] -> DocChoices

-- | Possible formats for printer output.
data Format
TeX :: Format
HTML :: Format
Jupyter :: Format
MDBook :: Format

-- | Constructor for users to choose their document options
docChoices :: DocType -> [Format] -> DocChoices
