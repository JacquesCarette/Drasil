# Scope of Requirements {#Sec:ReqsScope}

The scope of the requirements includes a PD Control Loop with three subsystems, namely: a PD Controller, a Summing Point, and a Power Plant. Only the Proportional and Derivative controllers are used in this software; the Integral controller is beyond the scope of this project. Additionally, this software is intended to aid with the manual tuning of the PD Controller.
